## Entangled Souls

Today was supposed to be a day before an anniversary. It was 5 years ago. I don't have any feelings of attachment only lessons. The relationship didn't end well (I thought it ended amicably). But I felt most loved and I regret not being able to sustain that loving feeling until the end. I was not the most patient and probably not the most caring. I regret not making my ex wife feel important enough. And if there were and are any issues left between us I think the only thing I can do is really focus on my own problems and try to be a better person. I think this will be a lifelong process. I genuinely hope that I am getting better. I hope that any self-doubt on my ability to truly be loving (not just because I am a people-pleaser that requires validation) will slowly be erased over time by evidence of my future and recent actions.

I was quickly enamored by my ex-wife. She was damn hot and beautiful. A great writer. I would always admire that in her. She was very intense and genuine. When I was still courting her, I read in her blog that she carried a deep pain that I thought I could heal. I thought I could "ride the waves" with her but I guess, I thought too highly of myself. I thought I have this supreme ability for "emotion regulation" or several more experience of being a diagnosed "bipolar" that I could "guide her". I was arrogant and misguided. I ended up drowning too, I became irritable and I gave up. Let me take all the blame. She gave me her everything and uprooted her life just to be with me. I wish I was better to her but really I think it is much better that we are not together. We have quite different values. It is also my fault that I committed too fast and promised her things. I also didn't follow through when I should've disentangled earlier.

I stayed with her because one, I didn't think I would be ever be loved as "deeply" again. I had other fears but I'll keep them to myself. I also thought that life with her was stable. With her I passed my classes and my qualifying exams. So romance wasn't a thing for me for a long time, and I was ok with our arrangement. I couldn't give her the "magic" she wanted. That caused a lot of frustration and resentment. I could not force it within me. Hence, I thought the best thing to do was to set her free. It hurt me when she left me on my birthday. But I was happy to see her smiling as she left for New York. I thought she seemed optimistic for this chance to fly free. I thought.

I wish her the best. And I am still committed to making sure that she'll be ok. But maybe just not by her side. That's the only difference. I hope she heals and finds her magic. She taught me how to be selfless. She taught me how to communicate and be patient (ironic). I might not have been enough during the relationship but I hope I could be better in the future.


## The cool "Canada Girl"

I met one of the coolest girls in my life through Facebook through a common friend who tried to link us up. She was a mathematical physicist. I probably put her on a pedestal for quite a while. I "chased" her! Because I thought, why not? This person's super smart, inspiring and absolutely hilarious! And she's cute.

When she turned me down, for the third time, I got so heartbroken. And I couldn't stay friends with her and looked for someone else to fill the gap. It was a wrong move to find a gap-stopper even if I was truly interested in the person I replaced her with. But moving on was the right thing to do. She taught me what it truly means to be interested in your own life. To do that things that you truly love and live an interesting and vibrant life! I am happy that we are still friends and even up to this day, I watch her with admiration as she continues to enjoy herself. I have no romantic interest in her anymore but I still look up to her.

## The happy "Christian"

I was 18 when I started my first long-term relationship. I was quite lucky to be loved by her for a while. I was young. I wasn't diagnosed yet so my emotion-regulation skills were terrible. But she tried to understand me. She couldn't always be patient with me, well because I was an annoying, always jealous, and was an insecure kid. She was already 32 when we got together and was at the prime of her life. I thought to myself that she probably deserved a man that was well-adjusted, economically ok, and was well, a man. She also expressed to me her frustration that I wasn't any of those and I wasn't Christian. I didn't believe in God and to her what we had was sinful. I was frustrated back then but I now completely understand what she felt. Today, I am just quite happy that she's gone far with her business and seems quite happy with a good man.

She always had a smile on her face. She had bright eyes and her laughter was quite infectious. Her friends love her and she loved them. She had a deep love for her family. She was also one of the kindest persons I know. My mom was quite endeared to her. And that says a lot.

She was quite an attractive woman not only physically. Her attitude in life was also. And I never lost that attraction until the end. It was I that wasn't super attractive. Well, I was a kid. One of the best things I've learned from her was to how to "let bygones be bygones". For the most part we were in a long-distance relationship and we only saw each other for a few weeks at a time in a year. When I'd pout or put on a drama show, she'd tell me gently, "I'd like us to make the most of the time we have together and be happy.". I probably wasn't able to do that enough times when we were together but her words stay with me up to this day.

## A Being in Time - Nostalgia and Looking Forward
I've learned that I am prone to nostalgia. Must be some frontal cortex asymmetry thing! I know it's sorta weird to write about the last 3 (mutual) loves of my life. I often become sentimental about the past. But not because I want them to come back (cue: Regine Velasquez singing "Sana Maulit Muli" and then a pause! haha). It's just because I feel some good warm fuzzy feeling inside. I deeply appreciate the good times and would not exchange them for anything else. Apparently, there's a Japanese word for it. It's called "natsukashii".

Whenever I get into deep nostalgic periods, I feel refreshed and inspired to look forward to the future. Despite what my ex-wife thinks, I wasn't always calm and collected. I did try to keep it together in public but my weekends were dark and filled with self-doubt and shame that things didn't work out because of my faults. There was a deep fear that I am not capable of love of any kind. This is probably the third week that I have managed to not spiral into derogatory self-talk. I am happy about that. I've gotten to a point where, I am ok with whatever is claimed and I can only focus on little actions that prove otherwise. I try to live life the best I can and continue to "correct" myself.

Internally, I think I have improved. I've calmed my emotions. I care deeply for my friends and for my ex-wife. I smile when I see them happy, are enjoying themselves and doing stuff they are passionate about. I see them in social media of course and I read their blogs. I guess, I'm not super "Narcy" that way? Skeptical me, needs more evidence though. :P I'll try to provide!

Now, I'm quite excited to start a new phase in life! I've started to pack up. Haha. I pack up quite early. Fun stuff ahead!

I am excited. I would really like to go back to CERN and Europe. Take weekend nature trips. Meet new people. Stalk Messi. hehe. See Aurora's? But I would be dishonest if I would not say how sad I am to be away from the people that I grew close with for the past few months. And there are many of them. Some stand out more than the others. One stands out more than the rest. But the brain is weird. And I know we can all be happy moving forward in time and space.
