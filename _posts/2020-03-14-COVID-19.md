Just about a month ago my friend and I were talking about the first COVID-19 case in Switzerland. In a country like this, I thought they'd be able to contain it. I was wrong. Now there are 300+ cases, whoops, wrong, it's about 800 now (as of March 12, 2020). Our human intuition is terrible when it comes to things like these. Although it is not as bad as it is in America, I honestly expected a more proactive response from the Swiss government. But when thinking about my institution's suggestion to evacuate back to the US, I still think staying here would be safer. I think it's better from a public health perspective if I stay put. And also, in case I get hospitalized, it is better here.

<!-- Add me in the statistics, if I test positive. (It's been 48 hours and they haven't gotten back to me.)  A part of me feels like coming back for a bit because of missing some people but -->

I just want to say again that I am not an expert on anything. I study particle physics. I do data analysis and I only have a general idea of how people do science. But that is it. So everything that is said here is regurgitated information from more knowledgeable people and I write this primarily for my own pleasure and learning.

# Flattening and bending the Curve
Hopefully, the graph I'm about to show you is something you've seen before. I do know of some math-averse minds that upon seeing a graph they zone out or scroll past it because "it's hard to understand". But the main idea here is, there are only a finite number of testing kits, beds, doctors and healthworkers. We need to slow down the transmission so that the number of cases during a specific time interval would not exceed the current capacity of the system. It would be scary to imagine the situation where healthcare workers would have to decide who gets to live and die.

So to "flatten that curve" it means that we must slow down the transmission rate of the virus. At an individual level, this must be done by washing your hands with soap and water, or disinfecting with 60-80% alcohol, and practicing proper coughing/sneezing etiqutte. (Please do not cough on your hands! I saw a lady cough on her hands yesterday. It was disgusting! And she was going to ride the bus! Unfortunately, I did not speak enough french to even try to talk to her. On hindsight, I should have offered her some hand sanitizer.) When sick, you must self-isolate and wear a mask if you can buy some. You will need to ask someone to prepare food for you. It is one's civic duty to avoid people and going out when you are exhibiting symptoms as it is during this phase that one is most infectious. On a community level, large public gatherings must be cancelled and containment through contact tracing must be employed. If healthy, we must also identify people who are sick and who need help.

So what's the transmission rate like as a function of time? Earlier, I talked about how our human intuition sometimes fails us. When we first heard news about a handful of COVID-19 cases coming out of Wuhan, China, a lot of people treated it lightly not knowing the fact that the disease spreads quietly undetected at first. Since it has an incubation period of about 5-14 days, many people are going around not showing any symptoms and are passing it on. And for every single individual infected, you multiply it by the number of people they interact with and some probability of getting infected. This may vary but overall, this spread of the disease could be mathematically modelled by a simple equation that many of us learned in school - an exponential equation. With this equation, we can predict the number of cases in the next few days. This [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kas0tIxDvrg) beautifully explains more about this and shows an animation of recorded COVID-19 cases outside of mainland china.

I would like to point out a number of important takeaways from the video. First, this is a textbook example of exponential growth, with a cap. That could mean that at some point, the population will be saturated that no new infections will be possible. This is described by the *logistic curve* in the video that accounts for the size of the total population being saturated with infected people. We absolutely do not want to get to that point. If you divide the number of NEW cases each day by the number of new cases the previous day and you get something greater than 1, then that exponential won't flatten out just yet.

Second, we can plot an exponential function on a logarithmic scale. This is often useful for variables that change rapidly over some other variable. In this case, the number of cases change rapidly per day. So we see a straight line instead of a curve. If we do a linear regression, what we find is the number of cases seem to multiply by 10 every 16 days. So it is highly probable that about 60-70% of the world might get COVID-19 unless preventive measures are taken. This [plot](https://twitter.com/SMerler/status/1237492257458204673) is illustrative of what the video has been talking about so far. The number of cases each day could be estimated by a linear equation since it is just proportional to the number of existing cases. The only way we could 'bend this line' is if we change that *proportionality constant* in that familiar y = kx equation. That proportionality constant k depends on 1.) *the average number of people someone infected is exposed to each day* 2.) *probability of each exposure becoming an infection*. In order to change those before we get close to infecting the entire population, we need to stop people from gathering and yes, even travelling for carriers. That reduces number 1. Number 2, we reduce the probability of exposure through disinfection, handwashing and so on. And it has been said, that when you are symptomatic, that is when you are most infectious [source: Singapore Health Minister Adviser (Speech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgc_K2x-GKA&feature=youtu.be&fbclid=IwAR3W0rgPZHDnB3cUeNm833XAkGTdnnSjduSDcFSHlrc_YnCeKTz_j0aK9zM]). When we reduce that growth rate, we can then avoid spikes in the number of cases that would inundate our healthcare systems. This is what it means to "flatten to the curve". For the linear graph, we want to change the slope and make it less steep.

The failure of our human intuition to recognize that small numbers could quickly explode led to this epidemic. Many treated this cavalierly and thought that it would not get out of Asia. And that includes me. Describing this as just a flu and the underestimation of its fatality rate (initially described at 2% but is actually closer to 4%), led many to dismiss other country's responses as overreactions. That is not the case. And there are people who think that their body can probably take this virus. Even if you are young and healthy, it is quite potent. Like what the video said in the end, "*The only thing to fear is the lack of fear itself...*". We must have enough fear for us to be hypervigilant about our hygiene and our effects on other people, specially the old and the immunocompromised.

# Containment efforts and Testing
### Who gets tested?
I think the first thing you must ask yourself, what are the protocols set in place witin your community? You must know those protocols and know which hotlines to call in case of symptoms. Typically, you need to call first, unless it is really bad, before going to hospitals for testing. You do not want this to accidentally be spread or you also don't want to catch the real bug in transit. For my communities here are the pages to follow with the hotlines:

1.) [CERN](https://hse.cern/news-article/coronavirus-information-measures-and-recommendations#situation-at-cern) <br/>
2.) [The University of Alabama](https://healthinfo.ua.edu/message-from-the-president/) <br/>
3.) Manila and San Pablo Laguna - Still searching. Will update. <br/>

While it is ideal for data accuracy and containment to test everyone, this is not always possible. For many countries even developed countries (the most striking one is the US), testing is not widely available. To be a candidate for testing, the following questions are asked:

1.) Do you have fever, dry cough, breathlessnes, body aches, diarrhea...? Do you have symptoms? Note that the symptoms would vary with people but the most common is fever and dry cough. <br/>
2.) Did you come from a "red-flagged" state?<br/>
3.) Did you come in contact with someone who tested positive for COVID-19?<br/>

The more questions you answer YES too, the higher the chance you get tested. This is not foolproof though. The problem with this is that it could miss out on cases caused by local community transmission and asymptomatic cases. So far the best data we have asymptomatic to symptomatic cases could be obtained from flights containing repatriated individuals from affected countries and of course the Diamond Princess where everyone was tested. In typical frequentis fashion, the more data we have, the better. But because of a lack of testing kits the best we can do is sample the population.

The test is done in a variety of ways and the most typical one I've seen is they poke deep into your nose (enough to make you teary-eyed) and collect swab samples. They could also collect it from your mouth. There are also tell-tale signs of the infection in lung CT scans. From reports, people who recovered from the disease show some permanent lung damage. My guess is that this is because of the dry cough and the peculiar way the virus attacks your respiratory system.

When you show symptoms and test negative, I would advice to stay cautious. You are still ill. It could be something else lighter and you are lucky. But in the worst case scenario, that result could just have been a *false negative* and you really had the virus inside you replicating. There are sources of error in the testing that come from handling, labeling, and human errors. I highly recommend watching this video that walks you through the process of  [testing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgyzdgf66eM&fbclid=IwAR17RW1ZmFd3_xn3-QwlKge49N9pAQ9ClCqBn3Lr59wiOjZBGFKJlY41uS4).

In Alabama, I heard there now drive-through testing sites and in the Philippines, a cheap testing kit was developed by a professor from the University of the Philippines. It only costs P1,500 and could give results within 2 hours. Imported testing kits cost P8,500 and takes several hours more to come out. In any case, all those tested must be advised to self-isolate or self-quarantine while waiting for results.


# Winning the war
For those exhibiting symptoms it must be emphasized that it is your civic duty to self-isolate and be transparent, specially with medical frontliners and the authorities. It is true that most people will heal from this after some time. I've read first-person accounts showing that even for those who are quite young and healthy, fighting the illness took quite a while.

When already quarantine or self-isolation, I offer a number of tips I've read from several sources:

1.) Rest and drink lots of water. You will need to ask someone to do groceries for you. Please do not be afraid to ask for help.<br/>
2.) Make sure that you have good ventilation in your place.<br/>
3.) It is suggested you disinfect your place twice a day.<br/>
4.) Hot showers do definitely help with your breathing. And the virus does like human skin.<br/>
5.) Monitor your temperature and symptoms. Additional symptoms may arise. Do not assume that you are already well one day and then immediately go out. Some personal accounts say that the symptoms go up and down. Be careful.<br/>
6.) When symptoms get worse call hotline for advise or in the worse case scenario go to the hospital.<br/>

I understand that all these suggestions are not

It could be an even tougher battle ahead for those who are immunocompromised and those who have preexisting conditions. It's not only physiologically tough, it is also a psychological battle.

There is fear, anxiety and panic over what is happening globally and this causes people to hoard essential things. There is also racism and social stigma. I know that the fear of being labeled COVID-19 positive also exists. That being one means you might have harmed others. There is fear over the next few months on what is going to happen with their careers, visas. I'm going to push my agenda and say that we need to elect science-literate leaders and leaders who would make healthcare widely available. We need leaders who would reassure the public with concrete actions rather than empty statements that "our response is the best in the world".

The good news is in some places the growth rate is slowing down. This includes China and South Korea. The government of South Korea together with Singapore, Taiwan and HongKong also gives us models on how to handle epidemics like this. They have learned from the SARS epidemic of 2003.

While our head calculates all possible future scenarios, preparing for the worse and being hypervigilant about our hygiene, we will also have to live one day at a time like what Tom Hanks said.

> ** *Y'all... As this escalates (and yeah, it will) I need you to keep something close. When people get COVID-19, it isn't their fault. It isn't a moral failing. This is a group exercise, and we pass or fail together.* ** - [Sarah Tuttle, Astrophysicist](https://twitter.com/niais/status/1238114798639833091)

Let's help each other. Don't be disgusting! Let's end this shit! I hope to see you when this thing ends.
