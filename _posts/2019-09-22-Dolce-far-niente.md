The past week was exhausting, in many aspects, so I decided to not push myself too much and only do things that are easy and mindless, like grading, making simple plots and playing soccer. But for most of the day, I did nothing. I read a book and watched "Eat, Pray, Love". (Julia Roberts is totally relatable for me here!) I learned a nice Italian phrase - <em>Dolce far niente</em>. It means the <em>sweetness of doing nothing</em>.

I've been doing this for the past few weekends - decompressing and not worrying too much. Last weekend was a challenge but I got out of "it". Walking helps me. It gives my head clarity to choose what to do no and what not to do.

I've probably running low on interesting paths to try along campus so I'm looking forward to weekend hiking around the Jura or Mont Blanc next year. Although, I'm probably not super excited to leave my friends here.
