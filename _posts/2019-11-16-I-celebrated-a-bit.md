I passed my candidacy exam. :)

No one's doing the posting for me. Not anymore. Not in socmed. I appreciated it before. I get a little shy though. People like some attention. But not too much. So I'm just going to do my humblebragging here. No metrics. No knowing who reads this. So no anxiety.

I did a few things right after. Ate lunch with my physics group. Thanked my adviser. Saw happy smiles.

Went straight to my "safe place". Dam broke. Physics was done. Met two counselors. Asked why some therapists are even licensed. Had the most illuminating talk with the other. Went through the "guilt stuff". Seeing my favorite person on Monday.

Physics keeps me together. When that's gone I can get sad. It drowns out everything else.

Same day. Went climbing. With friends. Done that 10 times now.

I was sad.

Aware of the potential sadfishing. But there's no fish to catch here. So it's ok.

I forced myself to run. Got a photo of a moon halo. It's rare back home. Met Saint Claire, Tanakah and Iva. Said goodbye. Felt better.

Started some paper work. Arranging visas. And the official admission to the PhD candidacy. :)

Watched a lot of Kristen Wiig, Regine V. and Eugene Domingo. Lots of laughs. Stayed with a friend. Still staying with that friend. Talked about how arrogant I am. Felt sorry for insisting on CBT. It is reductionistic. Now I understand how important it is to grieve. Yes, I am unmasked. Realized there's such a thing as CGT. B for behavioral. G for Grief. Masked me and unmasked me are one and the same. Trying to learn. Trying to live.

Almost done with Viktor Frankl. Finding meaning in life. Finally confronting deep-seated issues. Not just laughing things off. Learning to respect boundaries. Learning to set mine. Supremely embarrassed that I only knew that word at age 29. I'm sorry...

Went out with my two bestest friends in T-town this fall. They drank beer. I drank coke. Ate fries. Who cares. I do. Because it was pleasurable. Hedonic. A far cry from our nihilistic, existentialist conversations. We were not ruminating either. A little enlightened versions of ourselves.

Still sad. But not painful sad. Profound sad.

I got a gift too. And it made me smile. I want to do something like this.

I'm still a little sad. But at least I'm not masking it anymore? The dam burst open. The five years. The last few months. I made mostly good memories.

I wish I can start to feel excited again for what is to come. For CERN. For the Jura and Mont Blanc. I can't wait to see Jen. Thanksgiving trip might turn things around.

I wish I can be forgiven. I wish I won't repeat my mistakes. I wish I can break my patterns.

Tomorrow, we skate. And then I'll do physics again.

CBT is a short-term solution. I've got things to work on. Thought if you did it enough times it would work for anything. No.

You shall unstandardize the Standard Model. Joey said. I can feel Celso's words.

I can't wait to see Jen. Jen's my favorite person.
