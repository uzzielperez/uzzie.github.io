What makes us up? What makes up the universe? We've been asking these questions for a long time and we've come pretty far. So far that we humans finally managed to explain 4% of the universe. Haha! Everything else, we don't understand yet. So we call them "dark matter" or "dark energy".

For that tiny bit we understand that includes matter that make us up,some particles called force mediators and the famous Higgs boson. These particles are all neatly arranged in a framework that looks like a mini-periodic table. Mathematically, they're encapsulated in the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics. It's the most well-tested physics theory. It's predictions are incredibly precise and accurate. Think so many decimal places!

I have a set of fridge magnets at home and it's a cute little representation of the Standard Model particles.

It took scientists a while to figure out the patterns in the zoo of particles that they've found in colliders. It wasn't until the early
1970s that they sorted things out. It also took me a while to organize all of them in my head. My adviser gave me a good summary during our whiteboard talks and if you're interested, Sean Carroll also did a good job summarizing them in a popular level in the appendix of "The Particle at the End of the Universe".

Let's go through the fridge magnets in order of increasing complexity. These particles are of two types. There are the 12 matter particles on the left called Fermions and there are the "force" particles called Bosons. The Fermions are further subdivided into two categories: quarks and leptons. I'll talk about them in a little more detail later on. The bosons, are force mediators. There are four fundamental forces. There's gravity, the weak force, the electromagnetic force and the strong force.

| Type of Force         | Mediator       |
| --------------------- |:--------------:|
| Gravity               | Graviton (?)   |
| Weak Force            | W and Z bosons |
| Electromagnetic Force | Photon         |
| Strong Force          | Gluons         |

In the class of fermions, quarks feel the strong force while the leptons do not. Both quarks and leptons that have charge feel the electromagnetic force. Everyone feels gravity and the weak force! Not everyone knows, but the weak force is what's responsible for radioactive decay while the strong force is what glues atomic nuclei.

 Neutrinos are interesting and are considered as "ghost particles". They are neutral and almost massless and are therefore very hard to detect. There are about 100 billion neutrinos from the sun that are probably passing through the tip of your finger right now and you can't even feel it! I think the most beautiful detectors have to be built just to "see" them. Check out the IceCube experiment and the Super Kamiokande.

 Enough details, let's look at patterns. The quarks and leptons are arranged in three pairs called generations. Nobody knows why there are three generations only. The up type quarks have a fractional charge of +2/3 while the down type quarks have charge -1/3. They are arranged from left to right in order of increasing mass. The electron, muon and tau have charge -1 while neutrinos are neutral. If you pair these guys up, e.g. ud, cs, tb, e$$\nu_e$$, $$\mu \nu_{\mu}$$, $$\tau\nu_{\tau}$$, the difference in their charges is $$\Delta Q = 1$$. I won't talk about colors, hadrons and mesons yet. I'll reserve that for another time.

 The bosons have integer spins. It's important to know that the graviton remains to be a hypothetical particle. It has not been found in experiments. The last one found was the Higgs. It took about 50 years since it was hypothesized before it was found. That is an interesting story in itself!

These particles are the most elementary particles we know so far. We don't know if they're made of anything smaller. Before, we used to think that protons are just point particles but we have the technology now to probe them. We now know that they're made up of two up quarks and a down quark with a bunch of gluons "gluing" them together.

Right now, the Standard Model is the most successful physics theory ever but there still a lot of things that it cannot explain. So physicists are still continually testing it by making more precise measurements of standard model parameters or cross-sections of rare processes. We're also trying to look if the data we've collected deviates from the predictions of SM. And if there is any, there's probably some exciting new physics that we need to understand!
