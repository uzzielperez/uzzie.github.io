Sometime around spring this year, a Vietnamese girl in my dorm wanted be friends and asked if we wanted to walk around the park nearby and take photos of the cherry blossoms.
I agreed but I also had a pre-judgement of who she was based on what I heard from other people. The statement was "she has no spirit of community". I tried to suspend my judgement and see for myself.

At some point we got to discussing her life in New York and the Black Lives Matter Movement. I have very strong feelings and opinions about the "race card". What I see is that there are obvious systemic injustices against them which make them more likely to be underhanded in the game of life. And if there are "successful" black people, I think of "[survivorship bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivorship_bias)". (So many things have been said, I do not need to regurgitate). So, I was  internally agitated when she said that these people are using the race card as an excuse. And I started spewing the usual arguments for the BLM with passion. But then she told me about the news of a Black Security guard who beat up a Filipino woman to death in New York a few months ago. It wasn't on the news much. And she also said that she had felt excluded and disrespected by Black people in America but felt respected by White people. Somehow, I just saw this Vietnamese, Asian woman speaking of an experience and a perspective that explained why she thought the way she thought. I somehow felt like an asshole for not hearing her first.

Let me be clear. There are limitations to the written word and I sometimes don't have the ability to express the full nuance of my thoughts. For me, what she said weren't valid arguments against BLM. There's still a lot of concrete work needed to be done to fight towards a more systematically just world. My experience from 2016, Duterte winning, Trump winning was traumatic. And I wasn't the only one traumatized. But the reality is humans aren't purely logical creatures and their biases and predispositions are shaped by their personal experiences - where they grew up, how they grew up, what they've learned from school or their parents etc.

What I learned, in practice is that "shaming" and not listening doesn't work well if you want advocate for change - whether it's in the field of climate change, a change in the medical system, a change in vaccine hesistancy and so on.

## What I learned from a Teacher at an Evangelical school

I met an amazing teacher at an Evangelical back in Tuscaloosa in 2019. She recounted the challenges of teaching at that school as a Natural Science teacher. They were forbidden to teach Evolution and Natural Selection! I was shocked! Their textbooks
also say that the Earth is 6000 years old! What?! I was incredibly reactive. So I asked her, "How did you get around those difficulties?". Her answer amazed me. She said instead of directly teaching the "things we already know through science", she made her students do the science and go through the investigative process themselves. To look at the data, to do research and even do some digs (if I remember correctly). I was impressed at the outcome. Many of her students arrived at the conclusion that Evolution and Natural Selection are "real", save for a few who "saw what they wanted to see", those whose views are already calcified. This is her not arguing for "what we already know" but teaching her students a thinking toolkit - "how we know what we know". This made an incredible impression on me. I wish this could be replicated.


## It made a mark

Perhaps still not over my time with my best friend, I recall our discussion on how they lived with their mom who was an "all-natural advocate, vaccine hesitant" and an avid Duterte and Marcos supporter. ( I know her mom and she is a wonderful person. )
They managed to convince her to get a vaccine, which I am glad to hear! I also asked her why she remains loyal to Marcos and Duterte despite human rights violations and the incompetence that my best friend and I both saw. She said that in her mom's youth, she got a "Teacher Award" from the then President Ferdinand Marcos, Sr. I figured, she must have felt *seen and appreciated* by no less the President of the Philippines. It was a simple act but it was powerful.

I personally know people who were tortured and jailed during the Martial Law. My parents were both College students during the Edsa Revolution and my viewpoints were largely shaped by their stories. Living in Manila and the Southern Tagalog Region, I grew up with people and an education who didn't see the Marcos Era as the Golden Age of the Philippines. But people in the North and Metropolitan Mindanao see things differently.
