*Note: The idea of parallel universes are untestable and therefore for some scientists only a stuff of science fiction. But do feel free to read about the Many Worlds Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics. It is an interesting idea.*

### Day 1:

I feel something weird in my lungs. I decide not to go to work the following day.

I wonder where I got this. Must be from Wilson. He can't wash his hands. :cold_sweat:

### Day 3:

Dry Cough worsen a bit. Called CERN COVID-19 hotline. Was not a candidate for testing.

----

At the Large Improv Collider (LIC) last week, we played the game "5 Things".
In the first round I was asked to name 5 things that is made of glass.

Me: Windows <br />
LIC Chorus: ONE THING! <br />
Me: Eyeglasses <br />
LIC Chorus: TWO THINGS! <br />
Me: Cinderella's shoes! <br />
LIC Chorus: THREE THINGS! <br />
Me: Lenses <br />
LIC Chorus: FOUR THINGS! <br />
Me: *My Heart!*  <br />
LIC Chorus: Lol. FFIIIIIIIVEEE THINGS!! <br />

Ok, that was corny.
In the next round I was asked to name 5 things that I would do with my nose.

Me: Smell my friend? <br />
LIC Chorus: ONE THING! <br />
Me: Scratch my hand? <br />
LIC Chorus: TWO THINGS! <br />
Me: Sniff flowers <br />
LIC Chorus: THREE THINGS! <br />
Me: Sneeze <br />
LIC Chorus: FOUR THINGS! <br />
Me: *Contract Corona Virus* <br />
LIC Chorus: Lol. FFIIIIIIIVEEE THINGS!! <br />

Uhmmm...

### Day 4:

My symptoms subside.
Joke. Came back at night!

### Day 5:

Called hotline again. Became a candidate for testing. I line up in the ER. It was quite a long line. No social distancing. I tried to control my cough. I have actually developed a musical humming ability to cover up a soft cough. But it is no longer working. I imagined in horror how my strong cough could be like a strong repulsive force that will make people jump away from me. I try to breathe deeply and get some oxygen, but perhaps dead cell fragments in my pipes have clogged them up too much. I hum and cough. And then another came. And then a louder one! And another louder one!!! A chorus of coughs started. It turns out the last loud cough wasn't from me. I find out all of us were getting tested.

In these times it is more embarrassing to cough than to fart.

### Day 7:

I get new symptoms. I imagine Ali Wong and her face. She tells me "You need to eat a banana."

----

I have started people watching through the window. I have not started barking at them.

### Day 8:

Someone recommends to make things. Be creative. The only thing I've been so creative at was making copies of an unknown virus.

### Day 11:

I have taken the advice of Instagram's "DadLab" to draw something with my foot. I immediately thought about how long it would take to rewire our brain to be used to doing stuff with our feet in the event we lose our hands. I've decided to take it a step further and started to write emails with my feet. In fact, if you have received a message from me, it was written by my left foot. My right is still a bit slow.

### Day 12:

My symptoms have started to subside. This time for real.
My adviser's cats have started to follow me on Instagram. I feel honored.

### Day 13:

I decide to watch Notting Hill. For me the most relatable character is the Welshman, Spikey. Unlike him, I have never really met a girl named Pandora. I have opened her box though.

----

Exponential curves are becoming super popular. The number of messages I haven't responded to are also growing exponentially.

### Day 14:

I have learned that there's a lot of physics in vaccine design specially with the protein folding problem. I figured Marie Kondo could help with that.

### Day 15:

I could technically go out! I had a medical reason. But I was scared of crossing to France. Since bus trips were suppressed, I had to
cross the border on foot and the shortcut was through a field. It smelled like horse poop. Smelled like my childhood. I get to my doctor on time. It was nice.

The following day, I read this on the news:

### Day 16:

I do not remember seeing blue skies in Manila. That is why I often take pictures of the sky when it is blue in America and in Europe. My friend tells me that the lockdown made Manila skies so clear that they could see Mount Mayon and the Statue of Liberty from there.

----

I tell my friends to consider donating to the Office of the Vice President of the Philippines to fund the Personal Protective Equipment of medical frontliners. Here is the [link](https://www.ticket2me.net/e/5678?fbclid=IwAR1Q00HxocU-KulJM1vQjtug6SSnKyunFPgEUco6oL4n1TdZNnyARbtaD). The cost of a full PPE pack is about 7 usd. When you are done, boast about it. I will not judge you.

### Day 17:

I write something that I thought was inspirational in my blog. I shared it to my mama. She said it was depressing. I deleted it.

-----

WWWWWWWWWWAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH......

I'm OK.

-------

As my friend says, "Science must go on". We must continue to ask [important questions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3FRyPjUlQKk) that will advance our knowledge of the universe.

### Day 18:

I watch Bridget Jones Diary 3. Bridget is such a relatable character. So is Mark Darcy. What a bunch of weirdos.

---
I have found my Therapist on Instagram. DO NOT FOLLOW HER! The only boundary I shouldn't respect is de virus envelope. STAAAAAHP.

---
I find that listening to Irish Boy Bands makes me feel better.

### Day 19:

Dear Trump, if you decide to reopen the economy prematurely, there's some probability that the virus causing COVID-19 will mutate to COVID-20. It only attacks the epithelial cells of your supporters, and you will be patient 0.

I also spent the afternoon listening to my 60-year old room mate give the whole story of the two Korean dramas she watched on Netflix.
After she finished the two, she gave me the summary of the first 10 episodes of her 3rd Korean drama. After that, we talked about her love life.

----

Her story made me think about the concept of attractiveness. Humans adorn with themselves with jewelries, nice clothings, expensive bags to signal their status in society. I found the perfect way to dress up to be more attractive:

<!-- Discovered the song "Hold On" by Wilson Philips from "Bridesmaids". Damn it's catchy. I think my being a Filipino makes me have an affinity for karaoke songs. Lol Here's another. (Skeleton Twins). -->

### Day 20:

People are breaking down on twitter. People who share how productive they are are viciously attacked for their insensitivity for those who have kids and cats who are fighting each other during the lockdown. On this day, I have started talking to the pigeon who visits my window. Never have I felt so listened to my entire life.

----

I do a google search of the definitition of *productivity*.

-----

We have also ran out of chocolate chip cookies. I go out to the store and these are all that's left.

<img alt="catfood" src="{{ "/assets/img/catfood.jpg" width="20" height="20"| prepend: site.baseurl }}" />

I think humans can eat this, right?

----

Pele says that Cristiano is better than Messi. Me remembers data scientists saying Messi is better. But the debate is irrelevant at this point. Corona virus stopped all leagues in the world and football stars are now relegated to juggling toilet paper on Instagram.

### Day 21:

Geneva is still on lockdown and every douane has been closed but complete curfew has been put on hold based on mobile surveillance data. Hmmm. Big Brother. See [this](https://www.thelocal.ch/20200326/further-quarantine-measures-on-hold-as-mobile-data-confirms-discipline-of-swiss-population?fbclid=IwAR3kvGXIlelSaF7AqQ03XkWti8hPspYvsGMTVZ69jHb8Ild-jwQ4v9s1_bY). I guess it's ok for now. Also, my optimistic comment on Tuscaloosa didn't age well.

---

Today I learned that Boris Johnson tested positive. I guess herd immunity worked well for him.

Oh, I never really got my COVID-19 test result back.

----

Will learn Klingon. Making no progress in *Survival French*.
I have also considered learning about foraging.

----

 I miss 2019. I met new friends. I learned a lot about myself. Passed my exams. The worst thing was probably how Game of Thrones ended.

----

Started watching *The Martian*.
I have also started snuggling a potato in bed.

### Day 23

I ask my room mate what her favorite music is and introduced Spotify.
She loved it so much and started playing "[Never enough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jZVsr7q-tE)" on loop.

---

We cooked the potato I was snuggling.
