Today, I was only able to work 30 minutes. The whole day I was in physical pain because of an arthritis flare up. The last one happened when I had just arrived here at CERN. There are really things I need to change when it comes to work, living and my ways of thinking. I think it is also related to some psychological stress which I think I have gotten a handle on right now. Specially with the US government rescinding the ludicrous directive that puts in peril the visa situations of many international students.

On my way back home from my doctor, my mind was deeply wandering into some thoughts not related to the walking itself. I wanted to save some money by not taking the tram. I took the "Sentier du Rhôné". I was not aware there was a low-lying tree branch. And if you can imagine, I hit my head on the tree. Lol. I have a little bump on my head now.

I zone out a lot. I would like to be more present, appreciate and be thankful for whatever's there. I know that below some economic threshold, we have to fight for more equality for others, but that is of a different scope. And I can only say this out of privilege - a privilege of being in the best approximation of Utopia. For myself right now, I am happy to hear birds chirping, feel the cool air, see rivers, lakes and mountains. I am happy to see dogs and even humans jumping into the Rhone. They are all rather magnified instead of our calculations of what kind of future is in sight. There is a little fear of not being as productive but I am continually making progress each window that I am "ok". I am doing my best.

Sometimes, my idea of laughing at myself seems like I am making fun of other's struggles. I didn't mean to do so. And even if we have the same diagnosis on paper, it doesn't mean we experience things the same way. And we all cope differently. What I write here are reflections of the things I am working on personally. There is an awareness that I have an inner child and I don't want another person the bear the entire weight of my issues. (But yes, like my ex-wife I am happy to be divorced.)

I was for a while pining for my friends in Tuscaloosa. But I also knew that I will be far for a while. The pandemic was a setback. Travel bans abound. I wasn't able to meet as many people as I wanted apart from the friends I already had. But I will try again (in a safe way), enjoy and see what I can learn. There are some small scale social projects that have been put on complete hold. All on top of doing physics which is my priority, right now. I'm actually on the fun parts, to be honest. Now am feeling a little better I should close down on Phase II on physics analysis and the latest software issue soon.

My forehead hurts. haha. Next time, I won't get so lost in my thoughts while walking.

*Utopia* coming out soon.
