<!-- ## Getting Acquainted with markdown -->
I made this blog so that I could write about things that I would like to understand more about. First, I need to learn more about jekyll and markdown.
You can find the raw version of this blog [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/uzzielperez/uzzielperez.github.io/master/_posts/2018-11-24-Hello-World.md).

Let me start playing by adding some snippets of code.

  ```python

  from Earth import FunctionsOftheUniverse
  print "Hello World"

  ```

We can also try to put in an equation inline. Like this: $$E = mc^{2}$$.  A centered formula can be written like this:
\\[ x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a} \\]  How about highlighting in texts in color?  Here is <span style="color:blue">some *blue* text</span>.  And here is <span style="color:red">some **Red Bold** text</span>.

That wasn't so hard but took me around 4 hours to get all the settings right!
