I made this blog so that I could right about things that I would like to understand more about. Let me start playing with adding some snippets of code.

  ```python

  from queue import PriorityQueue
  print "Hello World"

  ```


We can also try to put in an equation inline. Like this: $$E = mc^{2}$$.  A centered formula can be written like this:  
\\[ x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a} \\]  How about highlighting in texts in color?  Here is <span style="color:blue">some *blue* text</span>.  On the other hand, this is, <span style="color:red">some **Red Bold** text</span>.
