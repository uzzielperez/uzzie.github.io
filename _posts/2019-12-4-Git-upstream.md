So usually I just follow twiki recipes prepared by more senior scientists.
I don't usually question what the lines and command mean but I should be more critical now! I'm usually happy as long as it works! There's this line that I've seen multiple times. Looks like this:

```python

git remote add upstream https://:@gitlab.cern.ch:somerepo.git.

```
Looking at the ever helpful [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8948803/what-does-git-remote-add-upstream-help-achieve/8948828) you use this command if you want to update your forked git repo with the latest changes in the original repo you forked. It's pretty handy. Now I won't forget it.
