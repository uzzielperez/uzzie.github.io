# A Fascination with the Brain

I cannot play futbol/soccer, run, hike because, duh, I broke my leg. And recently, I picked up indoor wall climbing and been doing it 2-3 times a week before I fell. I'd prioritize getting back to soccer so I've been trying to watch games and see the movements. I can't really do the tricks but I read somewhere that if I think about the sequences of moves and play them in my head, it's almost as good as actually doing it. It's not as good because I don't have the "hardware" to transmit the signals to actually perform the sequence of moves. So, I've to wait for mi leg to heal.

I don't quite remember if I've read this from Carl Sagan's book "Dragons of Eden" - which are admittedly just speculations on the evolution of the human brain. Either that or some other book called "This will Make You Smarter" which was a collection of essays. I don't know. It was 2013, I was first exposed to neurophysiology through pop sci books and discussions. And now, I'm reading Sebastian Seung's "Connectome" which discusses very similar things like, the "Phantom Limb", the roles of different brain parts, and the migration of certain functions to other parts. They're all pretty interesting on a pop level. On a more serious note, I'm also reading "The Future of the Brain" which contains essays from Neuroscientists. I like this one too because it has references to online databases that anyone can explore. Totally cool for doing open science! When things get settled, I will check them out and play with them - in addition to the Axelrod prisoner's dilemma simulations! (I need to prioritize dissertation and service work though or I'm going to get whipped!)

## Brain Waves. THE FLOW. In praise of the procrastinator.
My allomum was incredibly interested in Neuroscience so we bought this Brain Wave Cat ears for the science demos in the museum. I would often use it to demonstrate how the ears would perk up when you're focused or it would wiggle when you're distracted. (I don't quite remember what it did for what!). I don't know how accurate it was but it behaved pretty consistently for basic tasks like when I asked them to calculate stuff or think relaxing thoughts.

So Brain waves with particular signatures? Are they real? Are the brain waves emitted during a focused phase different from when you are more relaxed? Can a relaxed and focused phase coexist? What do the brain waves look like? Sorry, I don't have clear answers. But I have heard of the Greek-labeled waves - alpha (relaxation, visualization, creativity), theta (meditation, intuition, memory), gamma (higher learning, focus, inspiration),  Beta (alertness, concentration, cognition). These have different frequencies associated with them. The brain is an "electrochemical organ" so it does transmit signals at a certain rate. I am interested in looking at actual brain wave data. I found this [Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/berkeley-biosense/synchronized-brainwave-dataset) and bookmarking it!

Brain waves have been particularly interesting because I've also been interested in how people approach their work. Is there a method to their madness/brilliance? Are there common themes that I could extract that I could learn from? I grew up having schedules and timeframes and it is only recently in my late 20s that I became more relaxed. I'm still finding the sweet spot between balancing focused hard work, relaxed and creative thinking, and just pure relaxation In a sense, I'm not a cool person, and I know I need to improve on handling stress and pressure. Because I know this, I overcompensate by doing things way in advance! - I used to study well in advance for exams, scheduling chapters. I couldn't follow the schedules all the time but I used these timelines as a guide. Also gave me a sense that I can do something about my weaknesses. When I had to handle my logistics for CERN, I got my visa earlier than the average (a comment I heard from the Swiss Embassy person). I guess this is paranoia thing is good sometimes, but I also wish I was really good during crunch times. Like if I was on the spot and pressured, I would still perform and behave well (I'm getting better though!).

I guess I've only recently learned to relax because I also got to be friends with cool and easy-going people. I like it. I like how they temper me. I haven't really told them this. They're hard working too, but they know how to have fun! And they're the smartest people I know. My best friend is kinda like this.

So I think deliberate procrastination isn't bad as people think it is (unless it becomes incredibly stressful and anxiety-inducing, which ocassionaly is the case for me). I don't think Einstein always sat down and brute-forced his way into arriving  on his relativitistic equations. From the biographies I've read, there were a lot of walking, staring into space, chatting with friends about ideas. It's not deliberate work. It's relaxed and open. And then I guess the thought just crystallizes. It's totally fun when that happens and we experience "The Flow". And then the juice runs out. And then I guess, we relax again or work on some tough parts or loose ends in our ideas. We do whatever works and maybe learn if our methods could get any better!

Just a bunch of things I've observed from people who are into their work. I don't think we can always let our brain fire at a high frequency or low frequency all the time. Anyway, if I could, I want to collect brain wave data from these people!


# On the General idea of Idealization

"Assume the cow is a sphere." It's Big Bang theory joke that I heard back in college. It's a common thing in physics that when we're trying to figure out something we simplify our thoughts - like consider cars as point particles moving from point A to point B. Never mind air resistance. Assume it is negligible. Once we do those simplifications we find the problems become more tractable. We can figure out the velocity, or how much time it will take for it to get to point B. Basically, we have equations where we can make "good enough" predictions. "Good enough" because their are uncertainties, like "it will probably get there in 5 minutes plus or minus 2 minutes".

In experimental particle physics, we do something similar. For example, we have Standard Model predictions at leading order which is just like assuming there is no air resistance. We add another layer of complexity by considering higher-order corrections, next-to-leading order (NLO) or next-to-next-leading order if we can handle the problem perturbatively. (Note not all particle physics problems can be handled perturbatively, and it varies with the regime. For example, in QCD, the interaction strength of quarks/gluons, for instance, increases with distance. In short distances (high energies), they are sort of free. In long distances, the quarks are confined. We can only do perturbative predictions for the short distance regime where the coupling constant is greater than 1!)

In dealing with people, or other things we want to understand, our brain sort makes shortcuts too. We occasionally generalize. E.g. Filipinos are super friendly! Or the French are rude (I haven't confirmed this! They were extremely nice at the Charles de Gaulles Airport. Or maybe it was just Air France. Not a paid promotion). Those are probably "average" impressions! But not all Filipinos are friendly and not all French people are rude. You know what I mean.

## Idealizing people
The recent death of Kobe Bryant got me thinking of idealizing people. He was an inspiration. He seemed like a great father, and obviously he was a great sportsman who was dedicated to his craft. But he was also flawed, like the rest of us. He had a rape case that was drowned out and people didn't really know about that part. The victim was portrayed as a crazy person and eventually she settled out of court.

It feels like a Black Mirror episode. People grieve for a famous guy who they feel connected with but never actually met. I like how Jill Filipovic put it in her [post](https://jill.substack.com/p/kobe-bryant-and-complicated-legacies):
*... Kobe Bryant's life was never just about Kobe Bryant, but about all the aspirations and values we pinned onto him, and it is for exactly that reason that there is no disrespect or invasion of privacy in insisting that the inconvenient parts live alongside the admirable ones, that the ugly is neighbor to the exquisite.*. Nuance exists.

## Embracing the Strangeness of the people we love. Love is not unconditional
I think we do the same thing with the people we fall in love with. We look at them with rose-colored glasses. Bojack the Horseman said, "When you look at someone through rose-colored glasses all the red flags just look like flags". Embracing and accepting the strangeness or the quirks of the people we love, doesn't always mean we can live with them.

"I like you for the good and the bad". I said that to someone. I was perfectly aware of the situation. And even up to now when I talk to my therapists or psychologist, I talk about how I perfectly knew what I was getting into. That I understood that we both had tough times in our youth and we both HAVE issues. I know she made excuses for me. And so did I for her. I understand why I am being pushed away. It is a natural reaction for someone who didn't really have that kind of "solidity" and loving reassurance back home. So there's seems like a strong hunger for love. So it is extremely more hurtful when a relationship crumbles. Or when in the relationship, an idea of what love should be isn't met.

I probably had a different idea of what love was and I wasn't willing to change it. Even if it was kind of simple - like giving flowers, or taking her photos, or saying "I love you more". I couldn't do it normally, because I didn't feel it and I do not feel like I will be with someone who will ask for that. Sometimes, it's kind of dumb of me not to just bend and adjust to how one person wants to be loved. I will say and do those things when I feel like it anyway (?). There are more issues bigger than this. It's just one side of the story. Long story short, I understand the problems. But it doesn't mean two people who understand each other can necessarily live together. We tried. And sometimes, that's love. You have to let go. I have a long time ago. I'm just thinking about this now because, I think our interactions are actually getting better. But still everything just on practical money matters. I think it is good for me, at least.

So we have this idea of romanticism, and the feeling of magic, of butterflies in our tummy. I totally get how beautiful it is. But I have long dismissed it as overrated. I know when I feel it, (I don't feel it often), that it's just a weird brain thing, and that I am just physiologically reacting to some kind of attraction - but I cannot always act on it. Specially, if it is quite one-sided. And when it's not, I have to stop myself still because, I need to know the person. How does the person talk to service people over the phone? How does the person deal with money issues, and stress? Is the person emotionally reactive? Is the person career-driven? Does the person love other people's kids and not just potentially her own? Could you form a good team in solving problems? Is the person ok with a non-conventional arrangement or should it be a traditional one-to-one partnership? Do you have diverging paths in life? Those are important questions. And getting information is an important part of our decision-making.

I still standby what I said that "troubadour" romaticism is overrated. But it is important to "feel" something. I think that can be worked on. You just have to ask yourself, how hard should it be? It shouldn't be that hard. If it's too hard, is it even worth staying in that relationship? What's worth working for? Just me and my BIG opinion: I don't need to be with someone to love someone. I don't need to be "the ONE" to love and care for someone. That idea of love might be different in other's people's head. It's mostly a verb for me. It's not something I say too often. It's also not "unconditional". We can't be together if we bring out the worse in each other. Doesn't mean I have stopped loving someone as a human being. Even if the romantic part is gone, I still care very much.

Love and attraction of course is a weird brain thing. I have a relatively big forehead. Old phrenologists would probably equate that with good self-awareness. :P

# CBT, The here and Now
  - a valentine's date with the CERN psychologist
  - This week was sort of crappy but it turned around
  - physiological emotion regulation
  - some mistakes i made
  - thinking about apologies and second-guessing
  - common themes
  - Is this useful information?
  - why are there memories that we want to keep? Like how someone smiled at you the first time.. You're such a creep. Or the joke you said that made someone laughed? Or that you felt interesting and vibrant and curious?
  - love is a verb - and I'm not a fan of saying. And I still think romanticism is overrated. And that whatever feelings I have are unrealistic but should be acknowledged as something that influences my decision making, my motivations.
