### Some practical lesson
Before coming to France, I was warned that that the French are snippy if you can't speak French with the proper accent. So I did duolingo every day and was able to survive Charles de Gaulle Paris and my first trip to the doctor without encountering "meanies". In fact they were all sooo nice! (But maybe because I have a broken leg.) Nevertheless, my priors on the French people are updated.

Although I could not really speak in complete sentences, I could answer administrative questions with phrases or words but there was one thing I forgot.

Woman on Desk (WOD): *Gibberish... Gibberish avez-vous une (something insurance?)*
Me: Non.
WOD: *Gibberish Gibberish*
Me: Uggh.. lentement, s'il vous plait..
WOD: *Gibberish de Naissance*
Me: (Belatedly realizes she said *Date de Naissance?*). Ahhh!!! Birthday!
WOD: (Visibly irritated)
Me: Uhm... Juin... How do you say 25? Cinq Vinqt (In my head, how do you say the year).
WOD: (Lady slaps the table with a piece of paper and a pen!)

I thought I was super ready with the conversation with the doctor! But I totally forgot about the administrative stuff. Please learn from my mistake!

I talk about some of the things that I'd been preparing for the past month. All in English. And I'll write in a separate post all the phrases/sentences I learned. I haven't been super consistent with my French language studies so I decided to write about this today.

### Rendes-vous - Scheduling an appointment

When scheduling an appointment you can call their offices or better yet use an online scheduling application. You can quickly find a doctor within minutes! I found an orthopedic surgeon and a rheumatologist using [doctolib.fr](https://www.doctolib.fr/) and it's free. I wonder why the US doesn't have anything similar! I totally don't miss calling the Clinic for Rheumatic Diseases for an appointment. It mostly takes an hour or sometimes few hours to get through. Anyway, doctolib is super cool!

### At the counter
  You'll be asked to check-in when you arrive. You have to show an ID, give your address, insurance information (if you are using one) and your phone number. At least you have to recognize what the words and phrases are when asked. Then, you'd be asked to go to the waiting room (*salle d'attente*).

### Speaking with the Doctor (Depends on what kind)
Since I go to specialists multiple times, I've noticed that visits or consultations have a standard and predictable conversation patterns. They will ask you, common questions, like describe the difficulty when it comes to coming out of bed, tying your shoelaces, or opening a door knob. That's for rheumatology. For the orthopedic surgeon, they just ask you for an xray mostly, ask you describe the sensations you feel in your leg and they'll physically examine the range of motion that you have on your foot. Totally depends on what you have. You would be able to prepare for it. Luckily though, the orthopedic surgeon in Saint Genis could speak English. The rheumatologist I found lives on another side of France. I'm going to prepare for the worse that she speaks absolutely zero English and is intolerant of non-Francophones!

For the psychiatrist/psychotherapist, I do not think that I can afford to not find an English-speaking one. I need to be able to express my thoughts and feelings. Even at my level of English, there are still some things that I could not explain well to my previous counselor. So, I might have to look for one in Geneva. Fortunately, my insurances said they'd be willing to schedule an appointment for me and there's a chance I do not have to pay the total upfront cost.

### Paying the bill
For paying the bill, I thought it would be good to learn how to count in french. You can find many websites on how to count in French but I'll point out a few things that you should remember.

#### Counting in French
The basics: Counting from 1 to 10. *Un, deux, trois, quatre, cinq, six, sept, huit, neuf, dix*.

Next level, 10-16. They have special words to memorize too. *onze, douze, treize, quatorze, quinze, seize*. And then for 17, "10 and 7" so *dix-sept*. And you can guess for 18 and 19 they are *dix-huit* and *dix-neuf*.

For 20, 30, 40, 50, 60. They have special words too.
20 - *vingt*
30 - *trente*
40 - *quatre*
50 - *cinquante*
60 - *soixante*

And in between you just append the numbers from 1-9.
21 - *vingt et un*
32 - *trente-deux*
43- *quarante-trois*
55 - *cinquante-cinq*
69 - *soixante-neuf*

For 70, 80 and 90, they're a bit odd and long. For 70 it's 60 plus 10 so it's *soixante-dix*. And then you append the base numbers again when you want to count 75, 78, etc. For 80, it is *4 times 20* so *quatre-vingt*. That's how I remember it. Then for 90, it's *80 plus 10* so *quatre-vingt-dix*.

It's now easy for 100 - it's *cent*. One thousand is *mille*. I have no incentive and reason to learn how to count beyond a million so I'll leave that out. But it shouldn't be hard to learn.

When you go to fast food chains you'll probably get these numbers:

587 - *cinq cent quatre-vingt sept*
499 - *quatre cent quatre-vingt-dix neuf* although I hear them say *quatre cent neuneu neuf* something like that. I should check what it is exactly but I am lazy now.
384 - *trois cent quatre-ving quatre*

It's good listening practice in there.

### When everything else fails

When everything else fails, download Google translate. It could do "speech recognition" and uses computer vision to translate texts to english. And you can even use it offline if you download the whole database for "French". (Thank you Bayesians and machine learning technologists!). It's just very bad at handwriting recognition.
