I was slowly getting back to doing deep work hours and admitted to my adviser last Tuesday that I was "out of rhythm". He was understanding as always and encouraged me to ask the right questions and have an overall idea of how the different parts of the dissertation are going to be put together. I thought initially that it is quite hard to figure out what to do exactly with the different elements of the research if I don't just dive in and figure things out along the way. The problem with just figuring things out along the way is that we might get stuck in just one element and take too long there and then run out of time in more challenging parts. By challenging parts, we mean, we have no experience, no infrastructure or code base to handle the problem. And I must be able to figure out which are those challenging parts.

Despite the injury, and the brain fogginess from the pain meds I want to be able to make progress every day just to warm up the engine. Eventually, I want to be able to "own" this work, make decisions and figure things out mostly on my own. I'm still very far from that vision!
