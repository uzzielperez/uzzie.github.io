<!-- I've bounced back from a third local minimum. -->
To all my loved ones,

I've read this from a friend's post and I am surprised I liked it so much despite it being from a Christian page. It says:

*I know you're sad, so I won't tell you to have a good day. Instead, I advise you to simply have a day. Stay alive. Feed yourself well. Wear Comfortable clothes and you don't give up on yourself just yet. It'll get better. Until then, have a day. - Mindful Christianity*

I do not see this ending in a week or two. This will take months or even a year. We must be grounded in reality. But reality doesn't have to define what or who we live for. Reality gives us a way to plan for the battle in concrete ways. But it is in *slightly distorting* reality that we get courage to fight through even if the odds of winning are slim. At least in the foreseeable future.

In Viktor Frankl's "Man's Search for Meaning", a common theme he mentions is how people in the death camp holds on to thoughts of loved ones, hopes of the future to keep them from taking their own lives. Perhaps this is our much milder version of a death camp. What will you be doing when this thing ends? Will you fly to see the ones you love? Give them a hug? Have a walk with them? Look at their smiles and their eyes so closely? Share things that nourish each other? Hug them again? Laugh and eat together?

Once we get to that point, will we ever take those little things for granted again? Perhaps. And so I ask myself, am I taking something for granted now? Despite the seeming gloominess of it all?

I shared this a few weeks ago: "On Living in a More Light-hearted way" by Alain de Botton's *The School of Life*. The title has since been changed to "[*The Best Way to Face Difficult Times*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTfyrfnwouE)".

*And yet, one of the odder-sounding conclusions we might reach, after having had our fill of every kind of awfulness, is that there might still be a way to live light-heartedly amidst catastrophe, not because we don’t know – about the unjustified pain, the miserable errors and the imperfection of everything – but precisely because we do; because we know it all so so well and have had enough of ruminating on despair, a stance of defiance towards difficulty that draws its energy from full and over-intimate acquaintance with it... What lies behind this light-hearted approach isn’t naivety, it’s the lightness that comes from registering every kind of heaviness and transcending it.*

While we are in collective confinement, trying to keep our inner worlds intact, I hope we'll all pull through. There will probably several local minima, but please muster some internal energy to get out of the well. Even if it seems you're defying the laws of physics. Tunnel out. My thought experiments of the future has you in it. And I forsee happier, freer timelines for you. Have a day.

I leave with this song by Wilson Philips. This is approved by [Harold and Kumar](https://youtu.be/QHwvM8Lw4v0?t=30). With COVID-19 as our collective enemy.
