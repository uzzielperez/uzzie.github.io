<!-- I've bounced back from a third local minimum. -->
To all my loved ones,

I've read this from a friend's post and I am surprised I liked it so much despite it being from a Christian page. It says:

*I know you're sad, so I won't tell you to have a good day. Instead, I advise you to simply have a day. Stay alive. Feed yourself well. Wear Comfortable clothes and you don't give up on yourself just yet. It'll get better. Until then, have a day. - Mindful Christianity*

I do not see this ending in a week or two. This will take months or even a year. We must be grounded in reality. But reality doesn't have to define what or who we live for. Reality gives us a way to plan for the battle in concrete ways. But it is in *slightly distorting* reality that we get courage to fight through even if the odds of winning are slim. At least in the foreseeable future.

In Viktor Frankl's "Man's Search for Meaning", a common theme he mentions is how people in the death camp holds on to thoughts of loved ones, hopes of the future to keep them from taking their own lives. Perhaps this is our much milder version of a death camp. What will you be doing when this thing ends? Will you fly to see the ones you love? Give them a hug? Have a walk with them? Look at their smiles and their eyes so closely? Share things that nourish each other? Hug them again? Laugh and eat together?

Once we get to that point, will we ever take those little things for granted again? Perhaps. And so I ask myself, am I taking something for granted now? Despite the seeming gloominess of it all?

I shared this a few weeks ago: "On Living in a More Light-hearted way" by Alain de Botton's *The School of Life*. The title has since been changed to "[*The Best Way to Face Difficult Times*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTfyrfnwouE)".

*And yet, one of the odder-sounding conclusions we might reach, after having had our fill of every kind of awfulness, is that there might still be a way to live light-heartedly amidst catastrophe, not because we don’t know – about the unjustified pain, the miserable errors and the imperfection of everything – but precisely because we do; because we know it all so so well and have had enough of ruminating on despair, a stance of defiance towards difficulty that draws its energy from full and over-intimate acquaintance with it... What lies behind this light-hearted approach isn’t naivety, it’s the lightness that comes from registering every kind of heaviness and transcending it.*

While we are in collective confinement, trying to keep our inner worlds intact, I hope we'll all pull through. There will probably several local minima, but please muster some internal energy to get out of the well. Even if it seems you're defying the laws of physics. Tunnel out. My thought experiments of the future has you in it. And I forsee happier, freer timelines for you. Have a day.

 <!-- The future does looks grim. I mean, the forseeable future looks grim. I hope that when humans come out of this, the leaders would change, the systemic inequality would be addressed. I do not see that happening. And people are dying. On a personal level, I feel useless as ever. And all I could do is try to cheer up the people I love from a distance. They've been trying to cheer me up too. While I like numbers and careful evaluation of things, I have acknowledged that I cannot possibly account for everything. So I can probably look for a silver lining. At least I am not inside a submarine stuck with a mean person for several months. I do not even have to be in a submarine. At least, I am not an astronaut in space, running out of supplies, and watching the earth fall apart from a distance.

But you know what? There is some hope. The idiocy and incompetence of some so-called leaders are highlighted. The effects of inequality and lack of universal healthcare are felt. Some people are waking up. The brilliance, competence and sincerity of REAL leaders on the other hand have been outshining the nominal "Presidents". They are the ones coordinating the response to the biggest war we've seen this millenium.

Shall we use a bit of Steve Jobs' *Reality Distortion Field*? Shall we start beating Feynman's *War drums* to fool ourselves that we can do it? Shall we start telling ourselves that tomorrow might be better than today even if the end of this is seems out of sight? How many more weeks? The number of cases in the US will peak in a week or two.
The Philippine Congress has granted planless Duterte "emergency" powers. Just those two sentences sinking in nearly killed me.

We experience things very differently. For some people, this period torturous. For some people, this period is fun, a time to relax, reconnect with loved ones. For some, they are actually losing people they love.

This period reminds me of the book by Viktor Frankl - "Man's Search for Meaning". It is for me one of the best books of all time. There is a chapter called "The Case for Tragic Optimism". "How do you say yes to life despite everything?" *While I like numbers and careful evaluation of things, I have acknowledged that I cannot possibly account for everything.*

I do not advocate for toxic positivity. And I also am against absolute negativity.



Do not fight blind. Do not fight without a plan. But do not delay fighting. Fight every day.

I will not hope that you will have a good day.
