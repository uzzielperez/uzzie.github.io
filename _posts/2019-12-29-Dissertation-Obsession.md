## A model
My study buddy from college is probably the physics PhD student I look up to the most. He's pioneered a new technique in classifying events and particles using detector images. He's one of the most creative and compelling guys I know. He also communicates his ideas clearly and often asks questions that will make you think about your work. I don't think he asks to make himself look smart. He asks because wants to understand.

He's quite hardworking but also he's the type that seems to be ultra interested in the work he's doing. And his interest in his work often radiates with the way he explains his results to other people. I haven't reached quite that level yet when it comes to the work I'm doing. I haven't taken ownership yet and am still getting my rhythm back. I've decided to revisit a few articles on a "good kind of obsession" - one related to creative work output.

## Obsessive Focus and Interest in your own work

Obsessive focus and interest in their work is not uncommon among known geniuses such as Albert Einstein, Richard Feynman and Bill Gates. They could work for hours at a time on a certain problem. Mere mortals, including I, think that this ability to work without distraction is a mere natural ability that cannot be developed. I do think it is indeed easier to lose track of time and just get completely immersed in some work you are absolutely interested in. How can we take advantage of "obsession" as a productivity tool? And also learn to "unobsess" when no progress is made for a while, which means a new strategy must be made?

Cal Newport has a few blog entries on this. One is related to his Deep Habits series (Obsess When Needed](https://www.calnewport.com/blog/2014/11/13/deep-habits-obsess-when-needed/)). Another one was (On the Obsessive Focus of Bill Gates)[https://www.calnewport.com/blog/2014/10/27/on-the-obsessive-focus-of-bill-gates/].

## Having Rituals and mood setting

Having to deal with a broken leg and other logistical problems, my days have been quite fragmented. But I was able to squeeze in a few hours of work and was able to accomplish a major task which was to map out the components of my dissertation. I divided my dissertation into 5 different phases. They may change over time but having an idea of what milestones to reach has helped me a lot in the past when finishing projects. I've done Phase 0, and will begin Phase 1 this week and hopefully have some results to present to our collaboration meeting by the end of January.

But yeah, as I've said, my brain is quite foggy but I've gone through this before. So I have some level of confidence I can get out of this local minimum. I've let go of the "I'll work when I feel inspired" attitude. One can deliberately do creative, or important work even when initially uninspired with a combination of diffuse and focused modes of thinking. It takes practice to find something that works.

I picked up a few things from this [blog](https://www.calnewport.com/blog/2013/12/21/deep-habits-the-importance-of-planning-every-minute-of-your-work-day/). So here are some concrete things to do: 1.) Schedule undistracted work time chunks 2.) Restart "Streaks" and Deep Work hours tracking. So far this has been working pretty well with my french learning and my 'Exercising' habits.  I just need to adapt this to my physics work which requires more time and concentration power. 3.) Establish Rituals to set the mood for working. For physics and software work, the minimum number of hours to do 'ok' work is 3 hours. The first hour is usually "diffuse" thinking mode or mood setting.

When things normalize, I might have to work at least 6-9 hours a day for physics and schedule everything else around physics work. In these hours, I've to formulate my weekly questions, see how others approached the problem, attempt to answer the questions, and then communicate the results. For software, usually some time must be devoted to reading documentation and doing bug fixes, rewriting the documenation and then reconciling the bug fixes with the rest of the code base.

Might also read this book on [Daily Rituals: How artists work](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307273601/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0307273601&linkCode=as2&tag=stuhac-20). Let's see how this goes. Let's see if it radiates interest.
