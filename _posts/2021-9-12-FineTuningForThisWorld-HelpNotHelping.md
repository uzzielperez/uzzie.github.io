**A word of caution - heavy topics on Physical Degeneration, Trauma, Sexual Abuse and Suicidal Depression are discussed here. But I hope that some of the resources here will help you have tools to overcome your challenges or anyone you know who has them. Also a warning - that this is just stream of consciousness writing without much editing.**

After a few weeks of experimenting with a method that made me swear I had some kind of superpowers - boundless energy that allows me to work like I did in my youth, doing 45 push ups in one go, I am experiencing a sense of plateauing and tiredness that is not well-documented in 'marketing' of the said method. Or it also might have been the Coke and the Chips which I said was 'an experiment to reproduce a general feeling of unwellness'. I successfully reproduced it! And went home drained after the weekend's Pride March. Huehuehue. But this week was unique. The one-day tiredness from the method existed in all the other weeks I didn't do Coke and Chips.
So it was the coke and chips in particular for this week-long mild illness.

 I am still "well-enough" though and feeling much better than the endless fatigue from my RA or whatnot prior to the method despite the medication. (Also, painless stair climbing!) I am glad to have enough self-aware that the method could lead to overextending myself. But at one point, I had felt so limitless I wanted to Bike all the way to Chamonix, climb and swim Lac Blanc and camp there! I scaled the dream down though and will just take the bus. All I want is to be able to play soccer again. Or at least have enough sustainable some energy to finish my dissertation and get to the next stage of my life - hopefully some socioeconomic stability. (Anyway, I had finally scheduled my US visa interview. It was a pain in the butt.)

 I don't think I'll stay in High Energy Physics anymore though. High Energy Physics require High Energy Physicists. Huehuehuehue. I'm not so high energy.

 -------------------------------------------------------------------

 I previously took Plaquenil for my RA. But it wasn't working for me anymore and it was making my eyesight worse. The next line of affordable treatment for me is not an option, "methotrexate" - something that is also used to treat cancer. The top-of-the-line treatment right now, the "new generation, bio-engineered drugs" like [Enbrel](https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/health/whats-behind-the-whopping-price-tags-on-the-newest-generation-of-drugs/) is not an option for me. It costs around $5000. It's more than how much I earn per month. I used to have those injections though through some kind of financial aid but was only available in the US. My insurance, still owes me several hundreds of dollars and hasn't been replying to me (ehem, United HealthCare).

I also have a friend who was on Enbrel for years and had grown resistant to it. So, I guess, I have to do some homework, think out-of-the-box, and take matters into my own hands, if I still want to live. I kinda still do. There's an Enola Holmes in me that wants to figure something out! I'm an optimist. Sometimes too much.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

A few nights ago, my friends and I were talking about chronic illnesses, both physical and mental, (heck can't even tell them apart by now).
 One of them, a self-proclaimed psychonaut, who is also chronically ill with a host of problems, told me something remarkable. "Doctors spend around 9 years in medical school, doing several rounds in the hospital. If you are a person with disability, do you think you'll be able to survive the stress of medical school? Of course, not!" This is me reconstructing what she had said. I think it makes sense, sometimes, doctor and 'normal' people in general don't have some kind of 'sensory empathy' or understanding about what another person is going through. When she told me she needs to take some form of ADHD medications just to get her paperwork done and make some calls, I sort of understood as I go through phases like that too. Although mine is much less severe and controllable by "natural means".

I've also had conversations with other friends, they go to the hospital "We can't find anything. Nothing is wrong with you. Go home. It is all in your head." And then the disease progresses and the person continues to suffer, e.g. someone with gluten sensitivity or a weirdly beating heart. "Here take ibuprofen/prednisone/opioids that will help with the pain". They take it. It masks the symptoms, and the underlying issue goes untreated. The patient develops other illnesses as a side-effect, grows dependent on medication, and eventually have all their different body systems "out-of-whack".

------------------------------------------------------------------------

I hesitated to share the method that I was using until I tested it enough, i.e., I could replicate the "wellness" for about a month. While there are scientific papers on it and numerous "[testimonials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nOv4aNiWys)" among people with autoimmune illnesses - I knew I had to exercise some level of skepticism. But I also felt it was safe enough for me to try and do some research on why it works. The method is called the "Wim Hof Method".

I was rock bottom anyway, and the insurance wasn't responding, so I felt "I had nothing to lose and a lot to gain, at least in knowledge".

------------------------------------------------------------------------

"Is Wim Hof simply a genetic anomaly?" was one of the questions that some researchers posed. Wim was able to climb Mount Everest in shorts, he was able to climb Mount Kilimanjaro without acclimitization in less than 48 hours without suffering from "Acute Mountain sickness". He stayed in a tub of ice for several hours and has numerous world records. He's like a freak!

He claims that with his method "We can win the war on Bacteria!". I thought it was hilarious! He said that with 'cold exposure, breathing, and mindset' - the three pillars of his method, you could control your 'autonomic nervous system'- something that we thought was incontrollable. One of the [experiments](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4034215/) that scientists tried on him was to inoculate him with a component of the dead cell wall of a bacteria. If it was an ordinary person, the person would get sick, i.e. much like receiving the second dose of a COVID vaccine. In his case, he demonstrated, that he had the ability to control his immune response - a result that requires us to rewrite our medical books!

*Note: I do think that the three pillars should include "[nutrition](https://www.wimhofmethod.com/how-to-boost-your-immune-system)" though. If I ate it chips and drank coke, my level of training would quickly undo my progress in the method. I tried it! Hahaha. Too much sodium = Bloatedness. Messed up gut = Messed up nervous system. So far, according to my latest and greatest mental models.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

I got curious about the people who had gone through his program and the way they could be "proselytizing" how Wim saved their lives! I got to that point too, since nothing was working for me anymore and I was losing hope. I did feel that it "saved me". But I also want to emphasize a necessary level of caution in going through this route. One, there is a real danger of passing out, specially in water. Two, don't go too fast. Three, I think you need to take a break from it on some days. I'm still gathering my thoughts and would like to write a separate entry on this. But in a nutshell, I have a feeling that if you overdo this, i.e. hypercontrol your lizard brain, there will be some consequences. But then again, take what I say with a grain of salt, listen to your body, learn from more expert practitioners of the method and do "science". Be both curious and skeptical. We are all different and what works for one could be entirely fatal for another. Find your own definition of  "small doses of stress" that is ok to start with.  

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Tim Ferriss is one of those guys whom I've thought was just a "privileged" white guy who had a lot of money to burn to optimize everything in his life. He's the author of the "4-Hour Workweek". I didn't really feel that I was at the level of I want to optimize my blood sugar levels so that I could reach peak performance in soccer or be a top physicist. I simply wanted to feel well. It wasn't until I came across a BrainPickings feature on him on how he survived "[Suicidal Depression](https://www.brainpickings.org/2016/12/08/tim-ferriss-tools-of-titans-depression/)".

It completely changed my opinion of him. And I had finally understood how he could be so systematic, and OCD. That he wasn't simply a "successful guy" who fit himself and fine-tuned himself to be successful in the system. Suddenly, he was human that was relatable, flawed, and vulnerable.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

During one of my final nights in Crozet, I found myself listening to his [honest podcast](https://tim.blog/2020/09/14/how-to-heal-trauma/) with Debbie Millman. I couldn't believe that these two people that I admired were also victims of sexual abuse. It's hard to explain to someone else what sexual abuse survivors go through - the living through the coercion and the consequences of not submitting. Or if you're a child and you do not know what's happening. It's that kind of thing where your vocabulary isn't enough to explain what it is. If you don't have sensory empathy for it, it's hard to understand what they are living through every day.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

I've always been more interested in the *backstories* of the people that "made it". I get extremely curious about how they "overcame". It personally gives me fuel. Some people had to go through more hoops than others just to have baseline good living conditions - based on some kind of standard. But I also am aware of "survivorship bias". We only know of these "success stories" precisely because they made it through some selection process. For the majority, the odds are not in their favor. Why fight?

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Tim Ferriss and Debbie Millman are like superheroes to me. And so is Wim Hof. So, what's his back story? Probably at the expense of overtheatricalizing things, I'm sharing this [video](https://youtu.be/Ame5F9MaGJA?t=64). But what's overdramatizing compared to the enormous grief and pain he had gone through someone losing the love of his life through suicide?

Doctors couldn't help her. Medications just made the black hole inside her worse. For some medication could change their life. But for some, the overmedication could make them worse.

His journey towards gaining superhuman abilities came from a serendipitous moment of jumping into an ice cold lake in the Netherlands. It made him forget his pain. It was what allowed him to go through his grief and raise his four children.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

People with chronic illnesses, whether tagged physical or mental are some kind of experts in their own illnesses. They have sensory information of what works and doesn't work for them, a kind of information that cannot always be measured properly by smart watches, advanced medical diagnostics. I think we have to rethink the way we decide what works and what doesn't. And to let anyone know that "science isn't simply a fixed body of knowledge" that is held only by an educated few. Even the process of how we do it, "how we know what we know", need to be beyond the famous method we've all learned in school. Medical knowledge also needs to be shaped by the people who are actually in need of care.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the next few weeks, I'll be recounting the things I've learned from my deep dive into psychedelic research, addiction, fringe treatments for people with trauma, polyvagal theory, rewiring, why targeted treatments aren't always the best way to go and my two cents on the "self-healers" movement. I'll be sharing stories (publicly shared, not personal ones that were shared to me), about people who had found themselves in "rock bottom" situations and had explored non-standard routes to be well and enjoy life once again.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

How do they work? I have some speculations. I hope I can write in the same spirit as Carl Sagan wrote the "[Dragons of Eden](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-B52LZf6Es)" and with the beginner's mindset of Michael Pollan. :)

Good night.
