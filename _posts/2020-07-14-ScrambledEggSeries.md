*Today we've learned that the government has rescinded the racist and ludicrous directive against international students. Thanks to MIT and Harvard for leading the way in suing the government. Trump is evil.*

## Knocked out

I think when that directive came out, I was just totally out of it. I felt knocked out. It felt like it was one punch after another. And it was really hard to get up. I was preparing to pack my bags but I was told to wait it out and so I did. My adviser, our department chair and the international office have been mostly doing the work for me. I did nothing. And then this [news](https://twitter.com/thecrimson/status/1283116935853506560) came.

MUST. FIGHT. EVIL.

We won the battle now. Must recover some energy. Perhaps this would help.

## Before I can become a better friend

*How can I become a better friend?*
It has been my question for a year now since my separation. None of us have perfect childhoods and whatever void, insecurities and expectations we have carried along into our adulthood could be unfairly passed on to the people we thought we care about. So I ask myself, in what ways am I a child? When am I feeling like a child? I can't really do much about the other person. It's not super cute anymore when you're 30+ and you're acting like a child, right? Good luck with propagating your genes.

I noticed a behaviour, that sometimes I also act out, when someone is hurt or when someone's expectation isn't met. I've learned this fancy term called *[Negative Attribution Theory](https://estherperel.com/blog/how-to-fix-the-fights-youre-sick-of-having)*. For example, if someone was expecting flowers for valentine's day, and I didn't give any "You don't love me! You're a bad lover". But I forking hate valentine's day. We assume that one's character is bad because it didn't meet your expectations.

Well, it can also be very well true that the person was just simply out of love and tired already because of multiple *negative attributions* in the past. But the person is also at fault for not adjusting or communicating to the other that "am just not into flowers/or flowers are a waste of money" for instance.

I think this behaviour is kind of harmful. But I also know that when you're in deep pain there's very little you can do. That's why I am amazed at those who seem to still keep it together even when in the throes of agony.

Anyway, in the case of making apologies this is the best crazy ex-girlfriend song - "[You go first](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-anbK8DUOw)".

If you're feeling up to it, you can take some lessons from "[Seth and *insert name of friend here* clear the air](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=seth+and+kristen+clear+the+air)". I highly recommend the ones with Kristen Wiig, Fred Armisen and Andy Samberg.

My next question is, "In what ways am I annoying to live with?". **spaces out**
