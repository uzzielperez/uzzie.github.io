"You look well!" My doctor stared at me for a bit and then said those words with a smile and a look of astonishment and wonder. I said "Thanks! I actually feel really well now with a lot of mental energy." Although, I was a tad bit conscious of some acne scars from taking prednisone for longer than I should. Screwed up my hormones. But I immediately stopped the thought.

I proceeded to tell him about the movie *Limitless*. It's about a miserable guy who looked and felt depressed. He couldn't write his book, was sleeping all day and had troubled relationships. He looked like shit and felt like shit. That was until he discovered a pill that seemed to have turned his brain "ON". I told my doctor, "That's how I feel!" Of course, the movie was a bit of an exaggeration and a piece of fiction - like the Bible. After taking the pill, he was able to write his book in record time, learned several languages, learned about investing and picked up any girl he liked. Ehm, I am not practiced in the art of picking up girls and I only suddenly become fluent in french when I need to ask for the location of the toilet. Haha So I'm not there yet but I feel like I just took a pill that made my brain light up! There is an ease by which I could process information and also "select" which ones I want to process.

I told him a long story which he eagerly listened to. It was about what I've gone through the past few months since January when I last saw him - the "flat" months, the illness that hit me, the decisions that I made and the experiments I've done. I then courageously told him, "I've stopped Lithium. I still feel well." I also told him that I've already stopped Plaquenil- my rheumatoid arthritis medication since 2016. And I feel OK. I would even go as far as "I've never felt better in a while." It felt like my breakthrough moments after Crozet last year. Note, that these decisions were not done on a whim. I have felt that my "practice" and coping mechanisms in the face of misfortunes are now well enough that I do not need to rely on medication. I am still collecting more data and I want to write about the things that I've learned in a separate post. Talking about the "protocol" I have in place will probably be a little more information dense. (I'll try to make it understandable). It will not be a simplistic advice of "diet and exercise". Although it is in a nutshell, but it's not precise. And simplistic advices like that actually lead to nowhere if you never know how to start and maintaining them it feels "too much work".

-------------------------
A few months ago, I first mentioned the idea of the "[Dark Night of the Soul](https://uzzielperez.github.io/life/2021/02/12/WhatIWriteFor.html)".

**"I’ve had some times where I would go through a long hermit mode, “Dark Night of the Soul” which was something I thought was beyond depression. It was beyond a biochemical imbalance which could be restored by medication. But in extreme cases was needed and helped me endure the nights last year. It’s more of like an emergent phenomenon beyond the individual components - the physical, mental, your biochemistry, your feelings, your consciousness, subconscious. In my case I required a more holistic approach - medication, therapy, nature, exercise, good nutrition, doing something creative (which includes physics work!), long stretches of isolation, but still getting in touch with my loved ones."**

And I also wrote about the feeling of a "looming wrongness", a sense of existentialist dread that people who usually are not materially impoverished, like "third-world impoverished" and those who are usually a little weird, like me, sometimes feel.

**If people’s problems in here are more tangible, more identifiable, like “where would I get my money to eat?”, the solution seems clearer. But if the problem is existential… where do we even begin?**

I noticed that when I am physically unwell for a long time, my mind becomes unwell too. And vice-versa. Unfortunately, standard diagnosing and treatment protocols usually separate these two things - the mental and the physical. As I've gone through a lot literature the past year, to understand myself, my body and how I would like to live life, I've shed my former disdain of New Age mumbo jumbo and took a deeper look at them. But as a physicist, I knew the way to cut through crap was to *try*, experiment and be conscious about the placebo effect. I know I am eccentric but I know which New Age stuff are medically sound for me personally. I liked what physician and writer Jen Gunter said in a [TED Radio Hour Interview](https://www.npr.org/programs/ted-radio-hour/1000900071/jen-gunter-body-talk?t=1629918805504) - "if something has a pharmaceutical effect", it deserves to be investigated.

Unfortunately, it feels to me that the way we do "experiments" and test new medication now treats human beings as an *ensemble of identical particles*. So the "approved" drugs are only approved if we get 'good' statistics - i.e. if it works well enough for "most" people. But how about those who don't fall under "most"? How about those people who suffer from chronic illnesses? Sometimes, there are *incredible* stories of getting better that are just too good to be true and are beyond our scientific knowledge. A younger, not-so-sick me, would have dismissed them and said "Yeah, but that's just anecdotal evidence." But now, I wonder, if we actually listened to people's lived experiences maybe we could find something else beyond what we think we know very well.
And perhaps, explain the baffling mysteries back in terms of what we already know.

Each individual is unique. But different individuals are also the same in many ways. So I think we both need "personalized" and "generalizable" treatments. We can learn from both.

**Jack, 26, had been diagnosed with attention deficit disorder (ADD) as a child. Poor mental endurance and motivation made what seemed so easy and routine for everybody else a huge struggle for him. Just getting out of bed and completing an ordinary day left him both emotionally and physically depleted. It took him hours to read each chapter for his classes because of his poor brain endurance. When studying he was easily distracted and needed to constantly take breaks because he couldn't focus. He managed to pass college but moved back with his parents when he felt he couldn't function in the real world. He basically slept in every day and did nothing productive for more than a year. Jack's parents initially understood and gave him support and encouragement but eventually succumbed to disappointment and anger. Jack spent many days alone crying because he did not understand why he could not get his life started.**

**James, suffered from anxiety, panic attacks, sleeplessness, chronic pounding headaches and hands that constantly shook.**

I've paraphrased these from book "Why isn't my brain working?". I found that some of these "feelings" look so familiar. I see it in some of my loved ones - my closest friends, family, and even in me when I'm unwell. Some of them had become functional because of medication and therapy. But for some people, *asking for help* is too expensive. And for some it's even making them worse. Either the doctor is crappy or the medications have bad side effects. The author of the book Dr. Datis Kharrazian has been "working on chronic illnesses, autoimmune disorders and complex neurological disorders". I like how the book was written. He included a "financial disclosure" section for projects that he serves in. He also put in a disclaimer that the book was not intended as a substitute for personalized medical advice. Even though I think there are many crappy doctors, I thought this was a book really worth reading. There are doctors that seem that they are not worth the money. However, I've decided to turn them into my "partners", if they are sensible enough. I know that they are only operating to "the best of their knowledge".

Going to doctors also give you accesss to diagnostic tools that couldn't be fully be substituted by "mindfulness". Blood tests give you information on certain biomarkers that could tell you if you have gout or rheumatoid arthritis. Xrays could tell you if you have a broken bone or a lung problem. PET scans could tell you if you have something wrong in your brain. But if it's a psychiatrist, it's a little more difficult. Their diagnostics are prone to cognitive bias errors and DSM boxes are quite porous. I just don't think they even have a protocol against preventing misdiagnosis and overmedicating people. I know several people on complicated cocktails of medications. And while they are somehow more functional with the pills, they spend a lot of money, become dependent on them and are still kinda nuts to me too (what I mean is, still experiencing episodes despite the medication).

So when would be a good time to stop medication? When is it "not right" to stop medication? When should we take medication, given the information that they could have side effects?
I told my doctor, there is just one constant pill that I can't give up yet since "sleeping well" is absolutely essential to me. It's essential as breathing air. I want to write about my internal guidelines that I came up with.

---------------------
I talked to a physics mentor about my illnesses and how I am trying to work through them. I gave her a warning that it might be "TMI" - too much information. "I don't know. I think we just don't talk about these enough." I felt validated and glad that I just didn't dump stuff on her. I felt positive that day when I told her stuff. I hope to share the things I've learned for those who seem to be "stuck" - without necessarily imposing that my strategy would be the right strategy for anyone. The key is to "test" unless it's dangerous for you, i.e. if you have certain conditions that prevent you from using a certain treatment protocol.

---------------------

**Curious**
**Compassionate**
**Not being attached to an outcome**
**Playfully Persistent**
**Hardworking**
**Calm**
**Patient and Understanding**
**Honest, vulnerable (in a non-weaponizing way) and able to Directly Communicate**
**Confident**
**Better Decision Maker**
**Able to Walk the talk**
**Able to handle disappointment well**
**Resilient**
**Emotionally Agile**

These are just some of the "values" that I'm trying to cultivate in my journey to being a little less "emotionally and relationally" incompetent. But I just realized that all these values, having the "growth mindset", aren't possible without a functionally healthy physical brain. Fortunately, there are steps we can take, that are not so difficult to restore our brain health, hopefully before it's too late. It will help us be able to handle life's challenges, learn new things and eventually have space and energy for the people and projects that truly matter to us. And if it works for you, I hope it gives you a feeling that life is still worth living.

So perhaps, the *dark night of the soul* is just a *dark night of the brain*. And if it is, I hope you'll see the light after your long dark night.
