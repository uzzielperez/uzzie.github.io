I had just finished some light work today on some detector-related software. I will be continuing some light work tomorrow because I'd like to keep some sort of momentum on this issue we're fixing. And it's probably a good thing to keep the engine warm as I go somewhat full speed on the weekdays until Thursday. By Thursday I'm quite out of juice. And there's some physics analysis work to do as well.

While working I've thought of Feynman's opinion on learning the name of things.
When he was at Caltech he had gone to the library and asked the front desk for a "Map of a Cat". And of course the librarian didn't know what he meant until they realized that he was looking for an *anatomical chart of a cat*. It was one of those moments that made him realize that in addition to *understanding* beyond the name, it's probably useful to know the name as well. This is specially true when you are communicating with others.

It is the same with my work. I've been using GitHub a lot and there's been quite a vocabulary that I needed to learn to communicate with other software people. For example, there's the original repository which I "fork". "Fork" is like a copy of the original repository. Each time I start adding features or bug fixes to my code, I would need to make sure that I "pull" the changes from the original and then create a new "branch". It is in this new "branch" that I push my changes. When I am satisfied with my changes, I can submit a "Merge Request" and if the work is satisfactory and has no conflicts with the "base" or original, then it becomes part of the code.

Right now, I've only been working on easy issues and progress has been quite slow. I think I just have to keep at it. :)

Whenever I'm talking to my colleagues though, I try not to use fancy terms without really knowing what they mean. So I agree with Feynman about having a deeper understanding of things beyond knowing the name.

But I am amazed at how people remember several names or several items that are seemingly unconnected. I've had a hard time remembering the zoo of particles in the Standard Model (SM) back in my youth. It is only with time that I now know the SM table by heart. When I take a walk and I see trees or plants I don't know what they are. I am a complete idiot and I would take photos of them just in case I can ask my friends who know more about them. But each time I'm stumped and ask "what is this?" I wonder, "How do they remember the names?". There must be some framework in their brains that threads these names together.

During Feynman's MIT days he had also a disdain for the humanities. I might have adopted that attitude in college. But I did like Philosphy, my English and Filipino classes. I just didn't like studying Theology. I thought those subjects were too subjective. But growing older I've developed some appreciation for these things. Not everything that's true about nature can be described by equations, or numbers. Maybe we don't have the mathematical or scientific sophistication yet but nevertheless, the humanities can capture those truths in a different way. So yeah, maybe I don't agree with Feynman all the time. At least I don't agree with the young Feynman.

Like what I said in a previous post, Feynman became interested in other things outside of physics [later in life](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhHg7zfX-U). He had developed a friendship with a California artist Jirayr (Jerry) Zorthian. They exchanged physics and art lessons. I think I've to share this excerpt from "Surely, you're joking Mr. Feynman".

> **I practiced drawing all the time, and became very interested in it...I had a little pad of paper I kept with me and I practiced drawing wherever I went. So, as Jerry taught me, I worked very hard...Jerry, on the other hand, didn’t learn much physics. His mind wandered too easily. I tried to teach him something about electricity and magnetism, but as soon as I mentioned electricity,” he’d tell me about some motor he had that didn’t work, and how might he fix it. When I tried to show him how an electromagnet works by making a little coil of wire and hanging a nail on a piece of string, I put the voltage on, the nail swung into the coil, and Jerry said, “Ooh! It’s just like fucking!” So that was the end of that.**

They clashed in their view about *beauty* but they kept their friendship. Feynman had argued that scientists look at beautiful things, take things apart and see *more*. We look at beauty in processes, in smaller dimensions that are maybe only accessible by microscopes for instance. For him, those things only adds and does not subtract any beauty. This video on his [*Ode to A Flower*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VSG9q_YKZLI) is such a beautiful thing to watch. I felt so enlightened after that. I only learned recently that Jerry Zorthian had a brilliant counterargument to it. Again, parental guidance is advised for those who choose to watch his [response](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyDndEzmAZE). (chuckling inside ^_^).

I know Feynman's can be obnoxious sometimes just like some physicists. :P I just think it's important that point-of-views are nuanced and some statements can misrepresent people sometimes.
