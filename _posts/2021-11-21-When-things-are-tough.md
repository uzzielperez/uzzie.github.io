I told my friend that before he marries his girlfriend that they should write a letter to themselves on how they should behave when things are tough, when there are financial pressures, when there are health scares and when life is generally tough.
When times are tough, the primitive parts of our brain could take over. Our emotional and mental resilience are tested and we act in ways that could hurt the person we love. We make assumptions that they hurt us intentionally. We wear armors or use vulnerability as a weapon. I thought it was a simple practical tip that even when things "break", i.e. they decide to part ways or decide to reconcile and mend wounds they would have a reminder on how to act to limit unecessary suffering. 

I would probably do something similar for finding a partner for a project. I have recently selected someone to be my co-founder for a life science non-profit startup for people with multiple chronic illnesses. A project which I have been side-hustling on since August. I see that she is passionate about the project, believes in our mission and has the technical skills that I do not have to bring this project to life. I see in her the values that would fit in the [company culture](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1H8MZ-vzMDDCkM1C_iBtpa3jsIBMGOCdsyQwH9IFhnDc/edit?usp=sharing) that I want to create. So I envision a good partnership. But the road that lies ahead is uncertain and I imagine that there would be tough times. So far, working with her for a few months I can see a strength of character even when things are stressful at work. And as a bonus, we both have Austronesian ancestry. :)

When an illness hits us or our fight or flight response is triggered, we can act in out-of-character ways. I will expect this to happen. And understand that there is some distress behind the behaviour. And then we work on the source of the distress.
