This will be an evolving note on experiments to increase VO2 Max and Longevity and what the whole process means to me spiritually.

## Physical Activity 
As of May 23, 2024

* Min 90 minutes of walking everyday when not cycling
* At least 45 minutes of Zone 2 Cycling (I invested in a fitness tracker) 2-3 times per week 
* Norwegian 4X4 four times (or start with 2 times) once a week. Four minutes of intense pedalling reaching Zone 5, and 3-4 minutes of rest. Not to be done when HRV < 50.
    
## Nutrition

### Food 
### Supplements

## Medicine

* Still better to be vaccinated. There's a big difference in recovery times. 
* Lowest possible dose to control inflammation and minimize side effects
