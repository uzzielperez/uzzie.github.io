*Note: The Many Worlds Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics posits the existence of alternate or parallel universes. In these alternate universes, alternate realities are possible. As this diary exists only in a nearly parallel universe, it sometimes intersects with our real universe. Hence, the entries here are nearly fictional, nearly real.*

### Day 24:

I need to keep my shit together.

I have hydroxychloroquine. Don't listen to Trump. Don't self-medicate. It could cost you your life.

### Day 25

My mind just isn't working! I've been trying to read a paper for research.
I read the introduction 37 times and drew corona viruses on the margins.

I figured it was cabin fever and I was probably going to have my period. Always screws up my brain a bit. What if you could have your period only once a year with help from a pill? Would you take it? It's called [Annuale](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuQIEy_x9w4).

You should click on the [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuQIEy_x9w4) to watch the advertisement.

Some contraindications: "Do not take Annuale if you ever plan to become pregnant as it may turn your baby into a firemonster... Annuale may also cause you to develop a second vagina."

### Day 26 - 28

I have regressed to my old self of posting politically agitating content in facebook. It is hard not to get mad after seeing hungry people in the streets being beaten up by the police. They were simply asking for some help.

I feel like it is a moral dilemma to stay silent on these things. But I also know that by being so combative, people would only feel "personally attacked". They would not change their minds. I know really kind people who support Duterte and in the US, Trump. So for a few days, I stopped using facebook. It was not to be silent. It was to rethink my strategy. Some of these people also happen to be quite close to me. I have changed my strategy and have thought of an experiment based on what I observed was an effective way of engaging with these people. One way was to begin our conversation with what I like about the leader or the specific policy and slowly make our way into problematic parts, or the parts that need improvement. It's not as easy as simply posting funny simplistic memes. These people love Trump and Duterte so much that simply dumping them facts won't change their hearts.

Duterte is so loved in the Philippines that some people call him "Tatay Digong". Tatay means father. If I was a douchebag, I was going to tell my friend "*I'm so sorry I offended you. I didn't know you were Duterte's daughter.*"

Anyway, the system is so rigged, Duterte got "Emergency powers" granted by the congress.

### Day 29

My room mate has been watching "Home Along Da Riles" which reminded me of Dolphy's Gay role and "*Filipino Gay Lingo*". It's so evolved that it has it's own wikipedia [page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swardspeak)!

Sample:
Haller frennies. Kamustasa kalabasa?
Kahit di tayo makagorabelles sa labas, hope you’re not getting too taroosh.
Nakakalurkey (Nakakaloka) talaga tong quarantine na itech.
Watashi just want to say it’s ok to Crayola and make drama.

Translation:
Hello friends. Kamusta? (How are you?)
Kahit di tayo makalabas (Even if we can't go out), I hope you're not getting too taray (bitchy).
Nakakaloka itong quarantine. (This quarantine is making us crazy.)
I just want to say it's ok to cry and be dramatic.

### Day 30

I found a nearby park where I could do some laps! Scootering laps! Good cardio to pump some oxygen to my brain. It's been helping! It must be said that the park is within R< 1km of my house. Time outside is t < 1hr and usually close to sunset. Not a lot of people. Still no curfew here in GVA.


### Day 31

Little accomplishments. They just give me a bit of a “reward” in my funny brain. And it can be really frustrating in the area of research where “producing results” something is not you could check off your to do list, immediately. Like washing your clothes or paying your bills and so on. How can I be productive? It's frustrating and it's probably unreasonable to expect having results at the same rate given the circumstances.

So I’ve changed my goal. I just want to be ok today. And maybe check on my loved ones, directly or indirectly if they’re ok. And then maybe do the things that I feel like doing and bits of pieces of work that makes me happy. In fact, the minimum thing is just to *survive*.

The other night, I liked the feeling I had on my “walk” in the park. I just stopped for a bit and looked at the moon. And I just wanted to stay there, forever. I felt “ok”. And then I thought, what if I keep on “walking”?

I was looking for a way to evacuate to South Korea. Google maps only went as far as Iran.

### Day 32

A Senator in the philippines got corona virus. Then he got bitten by a dog and got rabies. True story. Cosmic Karma.

### Day 33

I've been listening to a french podcast on my daily walks/scootering. The new method has been working. This morning, my conscience has started talking to me in french.

### Day 34

I think it's a nice gesture nowadays that we check on each other while we are far apart. I really do like it when I get in touch with people. I am thankful when they check on me too. But does anyone feel the same way as I do whenever one's asked "How are you doing?".... It feels as if I start to stare at a void, and I feel the whole weight and feeling of existential dread coming upon me. And then, I don't know how to respond.

Possible Response A: (Lie a little bit) I'm fine. Thank you for asking. (END).

Possible Response B: Tell the whole truth of what you really feel and what's going on and explain everything in several paragraphs that would pass on the whole weight of existential dread to your friend.

Possible Response C: How is your arm?

I actually did C. I thought it was stupid but had the right intention. So maybe I made the right choice but maybe had the wrong effect (of seemingly objectifying her). But then again, another friend of mine suggested a better one. I will try that next time.

### Day 35

I miss home. I miss long Jeepney rides in the Philippines. Here's a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-9ga6LQ1I8&fbclid=IwAR1iBW5hKOyQAASCbsQVYzoow6e5OFWb_LdMtnOCYu3n1GsiQHGrWglzFjU)if you want to see the outdoors. And here's where my first job was - [The Mind Museum 2013 with the Junior Mind Movers! I played soccer with them before they got picked up by their parents.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlA7mNVCR6g), [The Mind Museum v1 - 10 min](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZDhxP5tPVo).

### Day 39

I've read about the significance of potatoes during hard times. Think of the Irish Potato famine and Mark Wahlberg in *The Martian*. So, I have started to value potatoes. Here is Wilson with a potato.

### Day 40

I didn't know this is how Germans got around.
