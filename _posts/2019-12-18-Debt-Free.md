I like the Animal Song! It makes me smile and makes me look Chinese.

Been a tough past few months but I had days I didn't spiral, thanks to the happy distractions my friends provided. I feel like I owe them a lot but they never made me feel that I owed them. I wish I made my friends feel the same. That nothing was transactional and that we didn't count what we did for each other, or who did more of what.

I know that there's this school of thought that today's mindfulness movement is fixated on self-transformation that efforts to resolve systemic/collective suffering is neglected. That's something I want to talk about another day. My happiness does depend on the society I am in but to some degree, I don't expect the world or anyone for that matter to give me what I want.

This is how I wish to live - for my mom not to worry about coming here because she thinks it's her duty to be here, or for anyone to think that my well-being is their responsibility, for me to share or give what I wan to share or give without thinking I'm trying to push for an outcome.

It's good to live debt free. And it's good to give freely without doing things out of mere responsibility. And you, we can do whatever we want, just don't be mean.
