*An Idea of doing things differently... I've read a pop psych book that said good mood is associated with better problem solving and better mental bandwidth. So am going to try to write some jokes every morning and eat them for breakfast. If obnoxious physicists make fun of me for taking advice from a psych book and tell me "but their results aren't reproducible", I don't give a fork! Go away! Shoo! And they already know they've got their issues and they're doing something about it! :P*

## Trying to be funny

I wanted to collect some materials in themes and record them for stand-up practice. (Whenever I will have the courage to do it!) And that I will post them when done. I can get bogged down by perfectionism and not write anything at all. Themes take too long to fill they also become too dramatic and I start crying... Ok, let's not go there.

Also, if I do this thing it really makes me feel good. It's not fake or forced. I believe we should pursue things outside of our field if we like them. For example, starting a fake religion.

Anyway, will start recording for delivery practice!

## Self-dialogues in the morning

Morning 1: Bed, pillow sooooo soft. I want to stay here forever! But I have to get up and fulfill my destiny!

Morning 2: Sun is up and my room mate's alarm goes off. I haven't actually slept yet...

Morning 3: Today sucks.

Morning 4: Where am I?

Morning 5: Who am I? What is the purpose of life? Who am I waking up for? I sit down on the bed. My bed hair is in its full glory. Tries to do a child's pose. I lift my my butt up. All in front of my room mate eating breakfast.

## Cheap room and back in Chamonix

I went back to Chamonix this weekend and rented a super cheap room. It's ok. It has a bed and a shower and a kitchenette. But the internet connection isn't there. Told the owner don't really need it. And the lights were flickering just like you know how cheap hostels are. But I didn't really super care. I just turned up the music and did my own "choog choog party".

Have been avoiding nearby people for the past two weeks. Couldn't really talk but I can do it now and scheduled some French lessons with a friend. I think it's about time I do legit french lessons. I did my best to speak french in Chamonix but my strong non-french accent just made them either, roll their eyes, start speaking english, or roll their eyes again. No just kidding. Most of them were nice.

<!-- This morning I ate at a place called *Le Little*. If I had a cool head this morning and was absolutely feeling confident I would have said "Je prendre un sandwich s'il vous plait." But the first things she told me were unrecognizable french words and I asked Ah "Do you speak english?" Wasn't even able to say you  -->

## Reading Books

I've been rereading a bunch of books like Guy Winch's "How to heal a broken heart", Russell Brand's Addiction book, and "[Ask Me about polyamory](https://www.bookdepository.com/Ask-Me-About-Polyamory-Tikva-Wolf/9780996460118?redirected=true&utm_medium=Google&utm_campaign=Base2&utm_source=CH&utm_content=Ask-Me-About-Polyamory&selectCurrency=CHF&w=AF72AU9STKQ2K6A8VCSH&pdg=pla-293946777986:kwd-293946777986:cmp-1578060869:adg-65091841852:crv-296436506046:pid-9780996460118:dev-c&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIn4n0xOq26gIVEdGyCh0A0wFiEAQYASABEgJW9vD_BwE)" book that my dance friend recommended to me. The last one is a great read even for monogamous folks. They're all pretty nice books and There are some elements that are the same like how "romantic love is an addiction" and how we can let go of it. But there are also some contradictory stuff like, you should "keep your heart open/ can't live life avoiding pain" and the other says "you should cut all contact and go cold turkey". Since I've gone through them already, I now view those with a different lens. That all these seemingly contradictory pieces of advice could work at different time scales.

Flash forward into the future "... it's been 84 years..." *Cue Titanic Song*

It's good to be aware of one's addictions of whatever form. It's good now the only addiction I have is coca cola.

## Self-Absorption and emotional pain

It's funny how I noticed how I can get so self-absorbed when I'm at a relative minimum. It seems like the problem is so big and your brain just hijacks your entire body. It's amazing. I forget that other people are going through something too. I'm not the only one that's having some difficulty in life. That's not to say that I shouldn't acknowledge the pain that I felt. For example, if I was the [monkey who only got cucumbers but the other guy got sweet grapes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meiU6TxysCg) for the same work! It's not fair! I have the right to feel pained!

Knowing these it gets easier to be so stuck up on my own problems. And when others are in a crisis, I'd let them dump out first and give them comfort rather than advice until things are a little better. It's hard though if you have to listen to someone in a loop of thoughts because she lost her memory. So it's ok to call for back up!

*I'm sorry if I didn't even bother to ask how you are.* Me to everyone on my bad days. I'd be willing to grow a second vagina just to take a pill that helps with those bad days.

## Authentic Self.. Yes, And

I've always been inclined to speak my mind. Specially when I was young, I was brutally honest. Whether we like it or not people are quite different and a blunt approach doesn't always work. And what we wanted to communicated does not get across. So I think putting that into consideration, i.e. being sensitive even to very subtle things that could hurt people makes me seemingly feel less authentic. Like if I were truly authentic, I'd tell everything as I see them, right? Like, "your idea sucks", "your foot smells bad". But I can't just tell them to anyone. That would be mean. That's why it's good to have friends who you could just be you! And you can tell them the most shameful of things and they'd love you the same. (Unless you really do something terrible to them.)

But the problem with just saying "I just want to be me", all the time is that we can become resistant to change and improvement. I remember this bit in "The Good Place":

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">When Eleanor said &quot;DO NOT BE YOURSELF,&quot; we felt that. <a href="https://t.co/CbDy79OLwP">pic.twitter.com/CbDy79OLwP</a></p>&mdash; The Good Place is taking it sleazy (@nbcthegoodplace) <a href="https://twitter.com/nbcthegoodplace/status/1233036565066199043?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 27, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Anyway, I think I've regained some mental bandwidth. I can hold two pieces of seemingly contradictory pieces of information in my head. :P It's good to be our authentic selves and choose friends and close people in our life where we could be us and continue to improve. But for now, don't just tell your colleague "your idea sucks". Specially if they're the "massive retaliatory striker" kind! :P

In zoom meetings, I've been very observant of how candid people can be with each other. In our HCAL meetings, I am one of the newest people so I am only a spectator. In our Physics BLM grassroots meetings I'm one of the seniors so I speak more often than most people. I've noticed two types of responses people make when the last speaker gives a suggestion.

Type I: *Let me tell you why your idea might not work* type. Then proceeds to specify the problems of the issue.
Type II: Ah, I agree with everything that you've said, but also here are some possible constraints (or sometimes there are none).

Type I sounds discouraging. Have you felt this? I don't take this personally but this is very subtle and can make discourage others from making further suggestions, unless they are the confident type who believes in their ideas! Also, I've seen people start raising voices. The second type, acknowledges the value of the suggestion and also gives some realistic constraints to consider. It makes the problem seemingly solvable rather than insurmountable. My adviser does this to me and I notice. :)

So, this is what I appreciate from the Improv sessions I've attended. The first rule of improv is to say "Yes, And". To "connect and not block" what your Improv partner presents to you. You have to make your partner look good. That's how you can build a scene.

Of course, there are times you really have to say "No", like if your partner wants to harrass you on stage. Ugh.

Anyways, I've learned to handle both types. And sometimes, no matter how you phrase something, if it's really wrong, you just have to say it as it is.

I suggest watching "Great News". The episode on Sensitivity Training in Season 2 is pretty related and cool.

## Long Lines

Last night I flipped through the channels and couldn't find anything interesting to watch. Again there was no internet so couldn't do netflix.
All the shows were in French too without subtitles. So I just watched the Simpsons. I could get it hahaha. There's this part where Bart is stuck in a super long line in a store and he's super late for a wedding. The line is super duper duper long. Oh, I just said that. He got so bored so he looked around and found a book on Spanish. He starts reading it. One eternity later, he is still in the line waiting. And he starts talking to the next person in line, in fully fluent Spanish!

It's so exaggeratedly funny!!!

<!-- ## Skeptics guide to (some) Romantic Music

* Without You - by Usher. You're an addict. You need to go to a rehab. I love listening to this though.
* Montana Sky - "If I can't have you, the Montana Sky will cease to be blue." At least it's just in Montana.
* 10,000 Hours - "I'd spend 10,000 hours, and 10,000 more oh if that's what it takes to learn that sweet heart of yours..." Why don't you just learn quantum mechanics and do your homework! *Puro ka kalandian!*
* 2 / 14 - "Second guess these words of mine, I've always thought that I'd be fine with you. But ever since we've crossed that line, I've got your green eyes in the back of my mind it's true. I can't be just friends. You're messing with my head. I know what I said but, these feelings they keep running the red." According to quora and google literature, you suck as a friend!

I don't understand why people romanticize stuff. Oh, yes! Addiction. - See Russell Brand's 12-step guide to unfucking yourself. :) -->
## Adults and their children versions when in pain

"Aren't we all children in a way?" I said one night in a bar. Everyone agreed except one person, "Not me." Oh, gosh I wish I could be that robust.

Anyway. I've noticed three types:

Type I: *The child that screams as loudly as they could.*
Type II: *The child that doesn't make a sound when in pain.* Tries to do self-soothing his or herself and nobody understands what's wrong except a magical fairy.
Type III: The type who says *ouch* softly, or once, and then proceeds to run it off. Subsequently breaks their leg.

## It doesn't matter

When riding a cable car, there is this part where your carriage needs to switch to another high tension wire at a tower. At that point, it would feel like the car is temporarily in free fall. Every time I see the tower where that change would occur, my knees would shake and my arms would tighten in fear. I've decided next time to not even think about it. I just looked to the side where the views are better. I knew nothing would go wrong anyway. Unless, I'm the extremely panicky person who would get super scared and jump to one side of the cable car and make it unstable! Not like that though. Knowing whether the tower was coming or not was inconsequential in this case.

I remembered the baby birds again who've been following the boots of field workers. Whether the birds knew or not if the boots were "real", is inconsequential. What the humans saw were irrelevant for the birds. The birds lived and were ok... No boots and birds were harmed. And that is all that matters.

I don't know if that made any sense.

## Mountain Goats

"A fleeing animal uses up to 3 times as much energy as normal which eats into its winter reserves. Help wildlife survice the winter by giving it the space and peace it needs. Respect the signs, avoid wooded areas, minimise all traces."

Omg. I should keep this in mind.
