# Charity
"I always worked harder than everyone else to get the same opportunities they had." These were words from last year's class Valedictorian from Ateneo de Manila University. If you want to search her, her name's Reycel Hyacenth Bendana. She's the daughter of a Jeepney driver. Her valedictory address was shared many times over and caused a bit of a stir among the elite. She said "Generosity means (there is) inequality. Inequality means that there is a hill, and the rest is down from the hill." *Down from the hill* is a familiar phrase in the Ateneo hymn [*Song for Mary* (remix)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhGmiZDH8Y0), which funnily sounds like the Canadian national anthem.

I also graduated with a degree in Physics from the same institute back in 2012. Ateneo de Manila is known as a University for "rich kids". Most of the population are children of Chinese tycoons, celebrities and Filipino politicians. I was privileged to get a financial aid scholarship there, like her. I couldn't say that me finishing college was merely due to hard work. I was also lucky. Lucky since grade school because of charitable people and institutions. I wouldn't have been able to go to school without them. As much as we'd like to think that upward social mobility is merely merit-based, it is sadly not. Some people have to work harder than others to have the same opportunities. Many in fact do work many times harder than others and still do not get the same break in life. And for the inspiring stories we see, those who have made it through, they're just a small fraction of everyone else. So merely saying "Just work hard and never give up" might be a simplistic statement borne out of survivorship bias.

This comic is a good short story about privilege - [On a plate*](https://www.boredpanda.com/privilege-explanation-comic-strip-on-a-plate-toby-morris/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=organic)

(And I also have to say, that I was very lucky with the mother I have. She persisted so that we can have a good education. I have also read "Rich Dad, Poor Dad". After reading that, I valued my education more, if you know what I mean. If you don't you can ask me.)
<!-- When I was 10, we had to move from Manila to the province. We lived with my grandmum in Alaminos, Laguna. My mom only had a few hundred pesos, or maybe a thousand pesos with her and she tried her luck in enrolling us in the best school nearby! It was just like Forrest Gump's mama trying to talk to the principal, except here in real life, the principal was really kind and she let us enroll without anything in exchange but a payment plan. And it went on until high school. Luckily, again, the next school year was free for the top 1 student of the class. I needed the "free tuition"! So I was competitive and uptight. Yeah, I didn't like my high school self. But I got through.  -->

I've been talking about my broken leg for quite a while now too. I managed not to go to the ER for 3 and a half years in the US. But then, in my final month before going to Europe, I fell from bouldering and my dreams of being debt-free were shattered. But I knew someone who could help me in terms of having a payment plan. I am good friends with the patient liaison officer of the hospital. She happens to be Filipino. She's quite well-known to the Nepali community because she's been helping them with the "charity paper work". I never thought that I'd need that help too. What if I didn't know her? I would have waited more than two hours to decide to get an ambulance. It's quite different here in Europe. Even without insurance, I could go to a doctor in France and I'd get the service I need. Well, Switzerland is quite expensive, but still cheaper than the US. There are many stories of people in the US getting into enormous debt and actually dying because they could not afford to go to the doctor or get medication. That is quite strange for a first world country. 

Charity is good. But it is not enough. We need to try to level the playing field. Been trying to talk about game theory in the past few months. The only way to do this is to put into power those who could change the game so that everyone would have the same fundamental opportunities or services as everyone else.

# Progressivism
I've been waxing poetic about Warren since late May last year. I didn't believe in "love at first sight" (or hear) until I felt it for two people. One was Warren! (Ok, I have a bit of a crush on her now, lol). But that's not why I want her to be president.

I was a Bernie fan first and then learned about Warren. Like every Bernie-turned-Warren supporter, I was attracted to Warren's pragmatism on top of her progressivism. She had a plan for almost everything, and that appeals to me a lot! She even has a plan for your love life! They were detailed and would work within the current framework of US democracy and politics. She was intelligent, tough and yet empathetic. She really knew what it felt like to be a middle class person. From healthcare, to education, to women's health, LGBTQI issues and climate change, I am with her. And guess what, so am I with Bernie. This part is subjective, but like any Bayesian decision-making, we look at our priors - past behavior. I think Warren would make a better president.

Now that she is out of the race, it makes sense for me to join the Bernie bandwagon. But feel free to give me inputs so I can update my priors. (In the end I can't vote anyway and I do not plan to campaign because I am not American. But as a non-American, I find it really important to be engaged with what's going on in US politics because what happens in the US will ripple strongly across the globe.)

My bestfriend Pecier, pointed out that Bernie "is actually a moderate center-left candidate by the standards of other Western countries, (especially by European standards)." He also thinks that the US is too conservative that Sanders and Warren are smeared as "radical leftists". The smear campaign actually works. Plus the misogyny.
Bernie is also not a true "democratic socialist" and that hurts his campaign more than it inspires people to join his movement.

Here is a video that Pecier called "a good antidote to the attack on Sanders's mere high-minded rhetoric" - [*The Case for Bernie Sanders*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PjNlBV-_s8)

I felt deeply affected by Warren's defeat but many of her ideas are still being carried by Bernie. From the words of her team "Elizabeth believes in her ideas and in the big, structural change that is badly needed to root out corruption in Washington..." You can feed people information about what these candidates are all about but I think voting is really largely emotional. We have to understand that. We have to understand why this progressivism appeals to us and why it turns others off. I would be nice to have a progressive world leader and not a child in power.

# Eat the rich
Does anyone have empathy for crying billionaires?
Have you ever seen that [rich-shaming video](https://youtu.be/N1sJjtQ0gG8?t=186) by Trevor Noah? I laughed and then I paused. "Oh my god, I'm so bad. I should try to put myself in these rich people's shoes." And then I did, and then I felt good. And then I realized, damn I'm soo evil.

I was quite disappointed in Bill Gates too when he said that he doesn't agree with Warren's tax plan. I thought he was the best among the billionaires with all the "charitable" and innovative projects he's involved in. But maybe, just maybe, this is loss aversion at play. Maybe they also want control and autonomy over the money, i.e. over which projects their money goes to. The desire for autonomy I think is fundamental for human happiness (there goes my BIG OPINION again). Could we make a plan that would incentivize these rich people to partake in a structural change that's better for most people? Would it always appear to them that they would be on the losing end when we seek social reforms? Are we going to stifle innovation and economic growth in a socialist society? Let's look at some data and facts - not the alternative kind. Brb. And also on COVID19! I hope!
