Growing up I’ve had issues with excessive guilt or worrying about if I’m a bad person. So this question of being good has been quite interesting to me for some time. I've had a friend who never believed in the idea of REAL altruism. For him, all form of cooperation is just people using one another for their survival. So he was quite machiavellian and he was proud of it. I was on the other side of the spectrum though maybe slightly shifted towards the center.

I am not sure where this excessive guilt comes from. Is it from a religious upbringing? I’m still trying to figure it out. It may be that it’s because I’m a massive people pleaser who cares about what people think or feel about me more than I’d like to admit. Or that I am worried that I’ve turned out to be a person that I don’t want to be. As an act of self-preservation, sometimes the idea is to dismiss the other person you hurt as overly sensitive. That's wrong. No one should do that. No one should minimize what the other person felt. I feel like the only way I can move forward is for one to also internalize that hurt that the other feels. One can't always make an excuse of external stress.

Letting excessive guilt linger is not healthy. I know that for a fact. It’s testing my emotional regulation skills to the limit. My allomum, my voice of reason, reminded me, when “croc brain” hijacks you, appeal to your cortex, the modern, logical part of the brain.

In a spat, or when you hear people tell mean things about you or to you, people react differently. There are people who are more emotionally astute that I am learning from. They communicate their feelings, say things calmly and walk away when things escalate to the point of mutual destruction. They have a healthy way of releasing their frustrations. Then there are those who are very pushy, demanding and unfortunately mean. Then there are those who let themselves be pushed to the point of breaking and being equally mean. Not good. If these people are made to interact with one another and you watch them, the possible outcomes are interesting. I wonder if there is a framework in which I could view these interactions. Do you let yourself be the nice guy all the time, or do you have to fight a little bit more to win in the long run? Is there a tactic to deal with meanies or retaliatory individuals such that you reach a mutually beneficial interaction?

I came across two podcasts from Radiolab that blew my mind. They’re called [Tit for Tat](https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/radiolab/segments/104010-one-good-deed-deserves-another) and [What's left when you're right?](https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/radiolab/episodes/whats-left-when-youre-right). They’re in my favorites list now! It talks about the “prisoners dilemma” — a two- player game with outcomes that are described in the payoff matrix below. The numbers there are the number of years they have to serve in prison. If you assume you are player A, silence has two outcomes for you. Either you serve 1 year or 3 years in prison. That depends if player B cooperates or betrays you respectively. If you decide to betray or defect then you will ALWAYS get a better outcome for each possible response of player B. You will be set free if player B plays nice or you will only serve 2 years instead of three if you both rat out each other.

To sum up, if you’re always a nice person, you are more than likely to always end up as a loser in the game unless the other player does not rat you out. So if the game is tipped such that more people are incentivized to be “defectors” or “betrayers” then how the hell do good people survive in this world? That is such an interesting question!

I don’t quite remember the details but one guy decided to make a contest where computer programs with different “personalities” or “strategies” were made to play against each other. There was the “massive retaliatory strike” program- the one that plays nice and then if you play bad will never forgive you. There was also the “tester”. Plays mean first and then if you retaliate will back off and play nice. Then there are the extremes. The “Jesus” program is the one that plays nice forever. There is also the “Lucifer” program, the one that’s always mean. Finally, there is the “Tit for Tat”, which has a very simple code which says “Be nice first”, and copy whatever the other one does. What happens when you let these programs play prisoner’s dilemma against one another? Who will win in the long run?

I think it’s a lot better to listen to the podcasts themselves. It’s deeply amazing how from an evolutionary standpoint, how being nice, and how being cooperative and yet not being a sucker can survive and even dominate the world. You have to be strategic but not exactly Tit for tat.

If the world is mean, find the good ones. Pick nice friends, kind people in your life. It’s ok to be picky. It’s ok to screen and filter. If this was a world filled with Lucifers, I hope the “good Tit for Tats” can find each other.

## Simulating the iterated prisoner's dilemma and Baby Morals

I found a github repo that will allow people to reproduce the basic results of the iterated prisoner's dilemma. You can follow this [link](https://github.com/uzzielperez/Axelrod). I'd probably spend some time playing with it when I get some considerable physics work done this week. I also found an experiment that tested if babies have some sort of idea of what "good" is. It's pretty cool!
