While the past two weeks has been productive on the physics end, I had felt exhausted emptied and decided to extend my weekend to late Monday afternoon. I think it has been a pattern that I go hyperfunctional or in other people's words, hypomanic when in some kind of emotional distress that I did not want to confront. And so here I am now.

As we await the official decision on the details, I just want to write something for the record. In a similar style to what has been said.. These are some things I'm not supposed to say directly, but I wanted to express nevertheless.

I thought I'd be good at riding the waves
On my own I was able to do so.
And I've found you, a spirit whose struggles were similar to mine.
There was very little resistance. Who was I to not take a chance?
For the first time I did not have to chase.
Everything moved fast. Everything also collapsed quick. Got rebuilt. Recollapsed. The entanglement was not built on solid ground. The pillars, the two people who kept the structure, were both fragile.
There was no beating. There was no abandoning. There was only letting go. It should have been done earlier. But there was so much fear. There was the fear of being alone. The fear of one of us not surviving the demise of the plans we once had. There was the fear of anger. There was the fear of facing nothingness and starting all over after being together for so long. So as not to face those [fears](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRhQMf5HMHU), you and I, mostly I, settled for being peaceful and yet unfulfilled. The fear of a short-term upset is just too strong for me. I was a child. We married as children despite our age.

Silly dance. I silly dance to make you laugh. It was foolproof. But you did not. I knew that was it. We were already a month into talking about letting each other go. I felt you were ready. There was a place for you. Some good people I thought you could rely on. Finally, I had the courage to let you go.

Fast forward to now - I reply to your singular question. I cannot thank you enough for listening to me and for believing what I said.

I'm standing back as I should. Not overreaching as I have been. And slowly we could finally walk on in the directions we wanted for ourselves. You towards shooting for your dreams. And I am always proud. And thank you for letting me go too and for letting me find myself.
