I scheduled a meeting with the psychologist early on in my stay at CERN. I've heard good reviews. She had a nice office with a good view of the outside world. She had orchids and she had a lot of "frogs". My favorite among them was a meditating frog. I mentioned to her that I have a friend who loves frogs. I got curious and asked her why she likes it. She said there is something peculiar about them being "still", relaxed and yet at the same time focused. A fly goes by and you'd think it's doing nothing, but it can stick its tongue out in a split second and capture the fly with great precision. She also said she grew up in the country side and loved watching these frogs grow from tadpoles.

Lately, this image of the meditating frog has been reappearing in my mind. I wish I could be like it. Quite like my friend, actually, in most instances. Just an observation in the limited time that I got to know her. I think this explains why she is good at proscrastinating.
