*I feel some hope that I don't need the most advanced, super expensive treatment after all!* But let's see...

This morning I was incredibly fatigued and had once again felt the symptoms that had brought me to the ER the other day. But I thought to myself that staying in bed would make me feel shittier so I decided to dress up.
Usually on weekends, I would go for a run. I have actually been able to do so the past few weeks because I've controlled my inflammation! I have been retraining for a 5K. But because of the illness I had to stop.

I also wanted to walk to the life sciences co-working space tooday because the weather was pretty pleasant. Walking by the lake is one of my favorite things to do. But midway, I felt I was too weak. I stopped and decided to take the tram. I needed to switch tram lines at Gare Cornavin so I got myself some salmon, quinoa and kombucha for lunch. I walked a little bit and I was breathing heavily and sat on the benches to wait for the tram that ends at the United Nations. I was so fatigued I sat like Manny Pacquiao after a tiring round of boxing. (But again, don't worry I am OK and it ends well!)

I have been collecting my symptoms in a journal for a long time. I also entered them in an application that uses AI to predict with some probability what my illness could be. But I felt they weren't super accurate in terms of figuring out the underlying cause of my problems. It was only when I had conversed with some folks yesterday that I felt I have connected the dots (with great probability) for what illness was progressing inside me! (But, I will discuss with doctors further to confirm). And it doesn't require expensive treatment if corroborated.

With my *hypothesis* of what it could be, I went to the pharmacy and bought some first-order, over-the-counter affordable interventions to give me relief for the day. I'll leave it to your imagination but these are safe, easy-to-titrate interventions. And now I feel good after trying so many things the past week and a half.

How do I know I am somewhat feeling better? Because I can make jokes again hehehe. I called my mom out of excitement and also told some of my GVA friends! But *knock on wood*, I hope this is finally it!

----------------------------

I really so how important communities are for people with chronic illnesses. They give you emotional support, they help you navigate a complex healthcare system that wasn't built for us. There's a lot of work left to do but I see a lot of hope and have been talking to a lot of patients, doctors and other key stakeholders on how we could innovate and find solutions for billions of people around the world. But first, let's start small.

----------------------------

More stories to come. But this time other people's stories to help us connect the dots :)
