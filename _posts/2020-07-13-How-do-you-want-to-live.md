'Nang tayo'y nagkakilala ng hindi sinasadya...'
'Ikaw lang ang napansin...'
'Nahuli sa isang tingin...'
'At sa pagbati mong napakalambing...'

Today last year matters to me.
If I were to lose my memory or if time will slowly let its "thought-of-beauty" fade away, I just want to write this note.
Today, today of last year matters to me.
It does not matter whether it mattered to anyone else.

Whether my brain is tired or sharp, whether it's skeptical or not, I had liked
that day. System I, System II speaking.
