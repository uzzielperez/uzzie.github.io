'Nang tayo'y nagkakilala ng hindi sinasadya...'

'Ikaw lang ang napansin...'

'Nahuli sa isang tingin...'

'At sa pagbati mong napakalambing...'

Today last year matters to me.
If I were to lose my memory or if time will slowly let its "thought-of-beauty" fade away, I just want to write this note. Even if I am already falling asleep.
Today, today of last year matters to me.
It does not matter whether it mattered to anyone else.

Whether my brain is tired or sharp, whether it's skeptical or not, I liked
that day. System I, System II speaking. I liked the place, the person, the feeling.. I liked myself. I liked the jokes. I liked the things we talked about. I liked that I didn't feel like I wanted to save anyone. I liked that I was enjoying myself. I liked the scents, the fact it wasn't so hot and was raining a little bit. I liked everything I was looking at. I liked that I wasn't the only one listening nor talking. I liked all the elements that made that day nice. The only thing I didn't like was the eel.

It is what it is for now. It was a beautiful memory that gets one through the hardest of days. Now, I've got to live this life I have right now and make new memories.

COVID-19 sucks. And so does Trump. But if we can make life suck a little less, let's do it.
