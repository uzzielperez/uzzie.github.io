*What are my self-protection mechanisms and thoughts?*
-----

One time when I was looking at a complicated set-up of electronics at 904, I saw a tiny screen that piqued my curiosity. One of the more experienced guys told me that that was part of the Detector Safety Systems. Just in case there was a surge of power or something goes wrong, it's meant to protect the rest of the electronics for the setup we have that mimics what's in the actual detector. I thought it was pretty cool and maybe I should have one for myself whenever I try to take risks or I try to work so hard or too hard. Like for example, I should once again return to keeping my week-ends sacred for my physical and mental health.

It reminds me of my friend's story about him jumping off a plane. He had the courage to jump off despite the risk of the parachute not working. There was a 1 in 1000 chance that the parachute wouldn't work. If that didn't work, there was a back up parachute. So the risks were calculated well and he took the jump.

I try to think of my own decisions in this way too. I am well-aware of my thresholds, bandwidth and my level of risk aversion. When I invest in anything, whether time, money or mental energy, maybe I could go all out without worrying too much when I can work within a risk threshold that feels safe, i.e. if I lose, I can win the loss back. That's the only way I can grow. Trying. Risking without losing so much that I wouldn't recover emotionally, physically, mentally from the loss.

But of course, our head's not always clear and we make wrong decisions or misjudge our capacity. We make silly mistakes because we're human. And maybe I've taken a number of risks too that took me a while to recover from. The battle scars don't always make you a better person. They teach us to not always keep doing the same things that break your heart... or leg. But then, what kind of life is a life without courage and trying? And then I look at my stitches and I know my "go and no-go" circuits just need to be reprogrammed a little better. I dunno what's better so I kind of just feel my way through it. (Sometimes, I check my resting heart rate and when it hits 80 bpm, which it did last Friday, I knew definitively I needed some deep rest for the weekend).

Anyway, I texted my mami a photo of me after a swim in the Rhone this weekend. It was more like a dip because it was freaking cold. I'm amused how still and clear the Rhone is. And the Arve too was less murky. I reckon that with the cold weather, the sources of the rivers, the Rhone Glacier and the glaciers near Mont Blanc aren't melting at a rate it used to hence the river flow rate being slow. My mama replied "Huwag risky ha!". Which is something she always tells me whenever I go out for nature trips. She tells me not to take risks. I sometimes like giving her a heart attack huehuehue. But I grew up without anyone at home, so I'm kinda used to going out to entertain myself. Maybe I do have this dopaminergic personality that I needed to balance out growing up (or even up to today I try to notice when I am most irritable and impatient)... I try to be more careful. Making sure my footsteps are stable before I take another step or another climb up. But that also meant being slower and second-guessing myself a lot more. I am trying to balance myself out neurobiologically and not just get so stuck in the abstract all the time. (I know I have the natural tendency.)

In my next post, I think I'd love to talk about when we become "Loopy" and a real life concrete example of when someone's brain becomes short-circuited and *Loopy* under extreme stress. It was seen in an MRI scan! Might be related to when we become "stuck in a rut", emotional flashbacks or being trapped in "bad cycles". How might we break off? I have some guesses!

Also, I think I want to go home and do some self-care because my brain is a little tired, fried and saturated.
