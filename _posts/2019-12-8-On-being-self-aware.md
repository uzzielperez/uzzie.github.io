A prerequisite to breaking negative patterns and cycles is awareness that such patterns exist. Only after being aware can we identify tangible steps to be extra careful about our ways of thinking and behaving. And we need to fully accept that we were in the wrong but not take it too far to say that we are not capable of change.

Yes, perhaps some people are more hardwired than others in terms of “iredeemability”. It is important to call out people. I won’t talk about the dangers of the online call out culture. That’s something for another day. Being challenged and being confronted about my own behavior is important to me. And not taking things too personally is something that I have also been practicing. So I am quite appreciative of people who give me feedback.

But my appreciation for feedback, regardless of delivery, sometimes makes me forget that there are other people who need to hear feedback in a sugar-coated way, specially on a bad day for them. That part I am trying to be careful about. I can ocasionally get too blunt.

There are traits we see in a variety of disorders. They are often comorbid traits - obsessiveness, the inability to concentrate, a fragile self-esteem. In combination with other traits, there may be some tendency for us to pathologize people specially through confirmation bias. I am quite guilty of this too, but mostly for pathologizing myself. And I have sometimes believed the “unofficial” diagnoses from people I cared about - that I might be in the autism spectrum or have OCD, and sadly be covertly narcissistic. But I also think that I objectively don’t tick many boxes that officially categorizes me under those labels. Maybe OCD is the closest looking at the DSM V tables (I need to talk to my therapist, about this.). But does it super matter? I'm not so sure. I think what matters more if there are traits that could be insidious and particular emotions that need to be regulated. Then we work on those particular symptoms and their underlying causes. And I do not think the underlying causes are the labels. For me they are simply for bookkeeping. But who am I? lol. In the end, I failed to "manipulate" the counseling center to diagnose me as a narc/psycho. But we all agree I have some pattern-breaking to do, and a divorce to deal with, in which I hope we don't end up putting each other down. 

We all have some of these “weird” traits. Some of them are quite useful - an obsession with numbers and facts, the ability to see things in another point of view, creativity. Some of them are red flags but some could be benign. I guess anything in excess is bad. So these traits when regulated are ok. But when these get out of hand, we have to be careful about not harming or hurting other people, making them uncomfortable, and eventually hurting our own selves. We cannot try to change other people but we can make them aware. It may be hard to rewire our brain, but studies show it might be more malleable and plastic than we think (ok, I’m lazy to dig up a study. Lol).

I observe myself a lot. And I observe people too because I’m trying to learn from them. Most people in my life are good, but I don’t really think I have good and bad bins. I think I “judge” people and see them slide from left to right in the "spectrum of good" based on my interactions with them. And I collect more data through time and get to know them more. I then decide if they are worth keeping connected with. But now I am more conscious that it not be in a forced or contrived way so that both parties are comfortable. Of course these are all thoughts in my head and we sometimes overestimate/underestimate how we may act in real life.

Such self-observation for me is quite helpful to address internal turmoil with or without the presence of external turmoil.

Sometimes I slip and forget about these things I already learned. This emotion-regulation thing is a kind of a muscle that needs to be exercised. Same with the “delight” muscle, the “compassion” muscle and so on... and also the “funny” muscle. To laugh in the face of adversity is such an important thing (without minimizing someone’s feelings, it must be said!)!
