Growing up I’ve had issues with excessive guilt or worrying about if I’m a bad person. I was and afraid of meanies. Sometimes to the point that I always try to get to their good sides. Been really close friends with a couple of them and we’d had discussions about the “Art of War”, the idea of cooperation and survival and the difficulty of just moving on and people not really understanding how people who intensely feel feel. It really made me think about the idea of morality outside of philosophy and theology classes.

I am not sure where this excessive guilt comes from. Is it from a religious upbringing? I’m still trying to figure it out. It may be that it’s because I’m a massive people pleaser who cares about what people think or feel about me more than I’d like to admit. Or that I am worried that I’ve turned out to be a person that I don’t want to be. As an act of self-preservation, sometimes the idea is to dismiss the other person you hurt as overly sensitive. I feel like to be truly compassionate, one has to try feel the pain they are feeling too (?) It doesn’t really matter what the label is. And the only way I can move forward is for one to also internalize that hurt in order to change things in the future.

Excessive guilt is not healthy. I know that for a fact. It’s testing my emotional regulation skills to the limit. Something that I’ve tried to develop for 9 years since I have been diagnosed with “Bipolar light”. My allomum, my voice of reason, reminded me, when “croc brain” hijacks you, appeal to your cortex, the modern, logical part of the brain.

In a spat, or when you hear people tell mean things about you or to you, people react differently. There are people who are more emotionally astute that I am learning from. They communicate their feelings, say things calmly and walk away when things escalate to the point of mutual destruction. They have a healthy way of releasing their frustrations. Then there are those who are very pushy, mean and demanding. Then there are those who let themselves be pushed to the point of breaking and being equally mean. If these people are made to interact with one another and you watch them, you could tell that the emotionally astute one would win in the end. It will not win all interactions because meanies try to get their way in the short-term. I wonder if there is a framework in which I could view these interactions. Do you let yourself be the nice guy all the time, or do you have to fight a little bit more to win in the long run? Is there a tactic to deal with meanies or retaliatory individuals such that you reach a mutually beneficial interaction?

I came across two podcasts from Radiolab that blew my mind. They’re called [Tit for Tat](https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/radiolab/segments/104010-one-good-deed-deserves-another) and [What's left when you're right?](https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/radiolab/episodes/whats-left-when-youre-right). They’re in my favorites list now! It talks about the “prisoners dilemma” — a two player game with outcomes that are described in the payoff matrix below. The numbers there are the number of years they have to serve in prison. If you assume you are player A, silence has two outcomes for you. Either you serve 1 year or 3 years in prison. That depends if player B cooperates or betrays you respectively. If you decide to betray or defect then you will ALWAYS get a better outcome for each possible response of player B. You will be set free if player B plays nice or you will only serve 2 years instead of three if you both rat out each other.

To sum up, if you’re always a nice person, you are more than likely to always end up as a loser in the game unless the other player does not rat you out. So if the game is tipped such that more people are incentivized to be “defectors” or “betrayers” then how the hell do good people survive in this world? That is such an interesting question!

I don’t quite remember the details but one guy decided to make a contest where computer programs with different “personalities” or “strategies” were made to play against each other. There was the “massive retaliatory strike” program- the one that plays nice and then if you play bad will never forgive you. There was also the “tester”. Plays mean first and then if you retaliate will back off and play nice. Then there are the extremes. The “Jesus” program is the one that plays nice forever. There is also the “Lucifer” program, the one that’s always mean. Finally, there is the “Tit for Tat”, which has a very simple code which says “Be nice first”, and copy whatever the other one does. What happens when you let theses programs play prisoner’s dilemma against one another? Who will win in the long run?

I think it’s a lot better to listen to the podcasts themselves. It’s deeply amazing how from an evolutionary standpoint, how being nice, and how being cooperative and yet not being a sucker can survive and even dominate the world. You have to be strategic but not exactly Tit for tat. I guess it’s generally healthier to let “bygones be bygones” but also have some form of memory of previous behaviours. Maybe it’s just me, but I think it’s better to be “mostly kind”, not overly retaliatory. If the world is mean, find the good ones. Pick nice friends, kind people in your life. It’s ok to be picky. It’s ok to screen and filter. If this was a world filled with Lucifers, I hope the “good Tit for Tats” can find each other.
