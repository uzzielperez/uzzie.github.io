Back in 2014, I've read a new take on the marshmallow test. The test was a famous experiment by in the 1960s by Walter Mischel. If a kid can wait and not eat the marshmallow, he'd double the reward. The assumption back then was that kids who are able to delay gratification were stronger and had more willpower. However, Mischel discovered something interesting. The "high delayers" had a mental strategy. They "controlled their spotlight", thought about something else, and simply looked away. "Some covered their eyes or played hide-and-seek underneath the desk. Others sang songs from "Sesame Street". Their desire wasn't defeated - it was merely forgotten."[1]
