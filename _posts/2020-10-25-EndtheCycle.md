## Deja vu

It's funny how as you get older, there are certain life events that seem eerily similar to what had happened years before. It feels as if you've completed a cycle, returned to where you were. If you do not do things differently, you are bound to repeat the same mistakes and go through the same trajectory. Sometimes, the patterns or cycles are not seen within your lifetime, but are passed on through generations. For instance, the cycles of poverty and histories of broken families or staying in dysfunctional households. They repeat if you are not aware. They get passed on. And you can only break the cycle if you know there is one.

I used to think when I was young that the Paula Cole song "I don't want to wait" was sort of an ultimatum song for someone. Obviously, the other parts of the song was gibberish for a young non-native English speaker. But it turns out it was a song about cycles of fighting and unhappiness within families that get passed on from one generation to the next. She said in an [article](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/paula-cole-dawsons-creek-i-dont-want-to-wait_n_5ace1b38e4b06a6aac8df856) that when she wrote the song, "*had a feeling my grandfather was going to die and the song came very quickly — like a lightning bolt — and I wrote almost all of it in one sitting.*". (And you could read about some corporate greed shit that she had to deal with).

But if this blog post is about **Perfection** what do cycles have to do with it?

## Iterations in becoming our best selves

Popular wisdom places special importance on the idea of failing and learning from failure or mistakes. *Those who are successful are the ones who were not afraid to fail and try things out*. But when we are haphazard and careless about our *playing around*, do we actually learn things? To be honest, now that I am a little older, I look back at my yesteryears and see how much I've learned. I looked at the cycles of rising up and getting back down on the ground. I've probably gone through a bunch of "Dark Nights of the Soul" where my life's meaning were put into question. And in those moments of reckoning, I've transformed somehow into a version of myself that was better than before. At least in my eyes.

I told my therapist that, it's not about making as many mistakes as possible, or when you're doing a project trying as many iterations as possible. What I've learned at this point is that it's just as important, in each iteration or cycle to **take a little time to get things right.** That's the only way we can enter the next cycle being more *aware* and conscientious of what we've learned from the past.

## Tensions

I used to play competitive chess and competed in some amateur soccer tournaments. When your training to be better, the goal is to expand one's skill, understanding of the game, mental fortitude and most importantly, one's physical abilities (yes even in chess). But what is often neglected by amateurs is the ability to recognize one's *current* limits.

On the personal level, I think specially when we are young is that we often have a poor ability to gauge our true abilities to be able to be a good friend, a good dog master, a good lover, a good parent or whatever role we'd like to have. Some are overly afraid and careful and never feel ready. Some on the other hand, are quick to jump in and feel like they'll just learn things along the way. It's hard to tell where the best balance lies.

As I said in an earlier post, I'd like to have a puppy/ a dog. But I also know I can't have a dog right now. I don't have my own place yet and I'm busy with dissertation work and also doing some work understanding myself. And part of understanding myself is understanding my limits.

Brené Brown said "the most boundaried people are the most compassionate ones". She was referring to the leaders and the people that she had interviewed. Esther Perel said boundaries are important in maintaining one's well-being. It's quite difficult to admit that I'm just beginning to learn how to set mine, and actually understand where they lie right now. And it will take some introspection to not make them too "porous" or too "rigid".

If we didn't know our limits, we will injure ourselves. If we didn't set our boundaries, we will be used or overextended and we will hurt ourselves. (But somehow, when we care about other human beings, specially when we do care about their basic living situation, it is hard to just leave them on their own. Even if they're hurting you somehow. The best of intentions are miscontrued. I just don't want to live like that anymore and had made a bold decision to leave/disentangle. And I believe that with some people, it is necessary to disentangle with totality. Specially when you have a lingering feeling of only being used, monetarily. It feels unfair and for me that is enough. I think it is ok to choose people in your life, who while not necessarily happy all the time are grateful beings. People are flawed and have problems, have issues they need to work on. We can understand those things but we don't necessarily have to live life dealing with them all the time. Even if we deeply care for them.)

When we take care of ourselves, when we're happy, when we're healthy, we're better friends, we work better, we're better humans. And having that peaceful demeanor, being less irritable is somehow contagious. If we want to change and improve ourselves, we somehow also need to change the world.

Self-care - being able to sleep 8 hours, being able to rest, eat healthy food, play and engage in creative pursuits are only enabled or disabled by the complex social system we live in, our communities and also the people that are closest to us. If we take care of each other, with healthy boundaries, we are also somehow taking care of our own selves. This is paraphrased from Brené Brown's podcast with Emily and Amelia Nagoski on Burnout and [How to Complete the Stress Cycle](https://open.spotify.com/episode/57lSXDGL5qiGCu1BWwHXJU?si=q7YLI5LETVK8i1vkvVWyRg).

Anyway, I think I'm shaping myself up to be a dog or cat owner. Let's see. :)
That'd be pretty close to becoming my ideal self and having an ideal world.

P.S. Happiness is not a default feeling. Ironically when we are also less judgemental of our sadness, anger and whatever non-happy emotions we feel, happiness does come around.


<!-- P.S.

I've been incubating this entry in my head for over a month now. I've finally decided to sit down and write about "Perfection", our ideas on it, how we attain it and so on. Today's actual date: September 2, 2020. I am also writing this as additional commentary on the "Utopia" podcast. -->
