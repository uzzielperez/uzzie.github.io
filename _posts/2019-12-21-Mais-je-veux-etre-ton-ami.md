## Disclaimer
This is my "first" short story in French. I'll be getting a lot of help from translators and I don't super care about any potential readers who are good in french. I'm just writing this for myself to think in French. My short stories are based on little nice or  "profound-for-me" things I've observed from people and my travels. These are from my memory, which can sometimes be fuzzy so I will have to insert some details that might not be super accurate. But do feel free to email me for comments and suggestions.

South Carolina, November 2019

I met a little sweet girl named Lira. She's four. She's small but don't tell her that. She gets hurt. She doesn't like being called small. She does know how to stand up for herself. It's quite admirable. Everybody loves her. Even strangers. She loves giving people gum and candies. And I like it when she comes to me and says, "do you want a gum"?.

I already said everybody loves her. During thanksgiving, all the bigger kids take good care of her. They tell her "Don't mind your classmates who tell you you are small, Lira. You have a big heart." And I just thought to myself, wow these kids really care about this little girl.

When we were alone, she asked me to push her swing. I was trying to be careful. She asked, "Can you push me higher?!". I said, "I can't. I'm afraid that if I do that you're going to fly off because you're SMALL!". Oooooops!

I was just imagining the laws of physics then. It was an objective thing to say. I didn't mean to hurt her. But she didn't throw a tantrum, she just said "awwww". Didn't know how to make it up to her. But I guess she also didn't take it personally. Because, objectively speaking, she was going to fly off to the air if I pushed harder. So, we were still friends.

She told me we were going to go see her best friend. Forgot her name. I guess she wasn't kidding because when we got to their place, I saw another little girl jumping up and down like a puppy or kangaroo in the window when she saw our car arrive.

They played in her ball pit with her dolls and all. They were "best friends" but they would also have little squabbles. The night didn't end well. Lira went home crying and broken-hearted. It's the kind of cry you hear that does not come from physical pain. All the adults talking about the stock market, physics, batteries, raising kids, buying cars, suddenly stopped. Everyone went to the ball pit to see what's going on.

"She doesn't want to be my friend", Lira said. Lira's mom told her "But you don't have to ask that, Lira. You are already friends". "But I want her to tell me." And the crying and conversation went on until we got home.

It's amazing how this single thing reminded me of myself. Even of some adults. Of how we take false comfort from the false certainty of a  declaration. If I could fly back in time and sit beside her again, I'd probably ask her "Why do you want to know, Lira?". "Would you rather she told you 'I'm your friend' but never actually play with you?". I wonder if I made her ask questions, would help.

Everyone loves Lira. And I'm sure her "best friend" does too. But she just wanted to hear her tell that extra thing. Growing up we know it's not necessary, in theory. But sometimes, we occasionally feel like a small kid like her and so we remind ourselves what Lira's mom said, "We don't have to ask." Perhaps. If you can help it.

J'ai recontr'{e} une petite fille douce. Elle s'appelle Lira. Ella a quatre ans. Elle est tr\`{e}s petite. Mais elle n'aime pas \^{e}tre appele'{e} petite. Tout le monde l'aime. Tous les plus grands enfants de la f\^{e}te  prennent soin d'elle. "Ne les \`{e}coute pas, Lira. Tu as un grand coeur.", disent les enfants plus \^{a}g'{e}s.

Je l'ai pouss'{e}e sur une balançoire plus tard. "Pourriez-vous me pousser plus fort s'il vous plaît?", dit-elle. "Je ne peux pas! Vous pourriez voler parce que vous êtes PETIT!". Ooops!

Je pensais juste aux lois de la physique. Je ne voulais pas lui faire de mal. Mais elle n'a pas fait de crise. Elle a juste dit: "Awww.."
