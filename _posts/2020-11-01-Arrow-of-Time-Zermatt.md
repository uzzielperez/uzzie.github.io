*For the moments not caught on camera, by photo or video, there are those snapshots made by the mind. They have a higher-definition. I can't plug my brain through USB and upload to Instagram. And that's what makes them even more special. Because, I was fully present.*

*Memories allow us to go against time's arrow.*

Sunday, September 7, 2020

I was at the Zermatt Station, eating french fries. I missed the train back home. Or how would I explain it? I dropped my Swiss Pass card, explained to the driver that I had lost it in the mountains. I really did drop it there! I showed my supposed ticket with the "Halb-tax" and "whoops, I bought the wrong one". Hence, I needed to buy a new one, for the full price, for 100 CHF. Smart. It was a Sunday so I couldn't get myself a replacement card in the ticket office.

But having been surrounded by friends who've been models of equanimity, I've decided to "relax", get myself something to eat and think of a solution. I got french fries and sat down at a bench.

I did some people watching and decided not to rush buying a new ticket. There were a bunch of kids running around while their parents were clustered close to the train waiting area. This was probably the most people I've seen during my commutes because I usually leave early in the morning or very late night to totally avoid crowds. (September also turned out to be the month when interns had started to flock in to Switzerland again.)

Still slightly disappointed with going over budget, losing my Swiss Pass, I turned my gaze towards the few pigeons who seem to be waiting for some food. I threw a whole strand, and one or two fought over it. The next time, I threw a couple more and a whole flock flew towards me! I then heard a cute little tiny voice shout "Das Machen Sie Nicht!!!" It was followed by cackles. All of the kids were looking at me and the eldest of them was pointing her hand toward me. They were all smiling and laughing so I had smiled back and giggled myself. And so I looked toward the parents, and my eyes squinted some more as my smile widened further. The little girl just told me, translated in English, "Don't do that! Hahahaha" And so poor pigeons didn't get anymore fries. Also, don't worry, I was more than 6 feet away from all of them except the birdies.

It might be some bias but I've concluded that that brief laughter with strangers had an incredible effect on me. I had suddenly thought of some way to get back home without spending 100 CHF and without having to call a friend from Geneva "Please pick me up from the foothills of the Matterhorn." The solution was to call some number that has access to a database of all the people with the swiss pass account, get the SBB app and enter a verification thing that will allow you to carry a digital pass. (Which I totally didn't know existed beforehand).

I think ever since that happened, I've recovered some ability to just socially interact with people (in a safe and distanced way). It is some skill we have lost amidst the pandemic, rightly so as we want to limit the spread of the disease. I think during the pandemic, we've seen everybody as a source of pathogen. And in my case, felt I too was a source of pathogen hence there is always this imaginary bubble or force field that kept me physically and emotionally apart from people for most of the time.

In the succeeding hours and days after that, I have met some more strangers and tried to invest some time in collective and personal pursuits. I've learned not only about myself but about the [quality of social connections](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lT7o2zflFaDeD8An9zhri?si=ZxcryerpT8qWmDcIeAQfEA) I have - the things that were great, the things that needed to be worked on. I had started to understand that loneliness could creep in despite one's ability to enjoy one's own company, enjoy solitude. The judgment we cast on having a feeling of "loneliness" makes us afraid to talk about it. If we can talk about it, in our own safe spaces, empathize with another person, an old person living alone, a person who had moved to a foreign land not speaking the language, a person who had just broken up with a partner, a person who is disconnected from the community, - then maybe we could understand each other a little better. Being heard and understood are normal and natural human needs. We do not need to be understood by everybody. We do not need to be rescued from our loneliness. But maybe a little understanding and company would help us endure.

A few more key things I realized:
- Good friendships take time to form. They cannot be hotwired.
- There is a certain pureness in meeting strangers.
- I forgot the joy in small pleasantries with strangers. "Bonjour!" "Grüezi!", small talk or offering some seating space. The thing that warms your heart, must be an "oxytocin pump".
- I would financially and emotionally prepare myself to have a dog/cat at the very least after I graduate.

I'm ending this post with a movie quote that I heard from one of my best friends. It's about a guy who had given up his possessions, thousands of dollars of money and hiked across North America to Alaska in [search of himself](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWRHTFwpRys). In his dying moments, he had written "*HAPPINESS IS ONLY REAL WHEN IT IS SHARED*".

I curiously ran across this [medium post](https://thatnameasif.medium.com/happiness-is-only-real-when-shared-377c871eb65a) from a guy who had had asked real and interesting questions about this statement. "*It isn’t a philosophical kick from a 20-something kid who, bored out of his mind, decides to be pseudo-intellect and shit on the world with pretentious quotes. It comes from a person who likely sees his impending death very close. He’s weak, he’s alone, he’s tired, and he’s hungry. In such a desperate time, it could perhaps be his epiphany.*"

He continues, "*But it’s also scary for a person like me who personally finds self-sufficiency and seclusion as the fundamental preference of life. For someone who loves living alone and finding happiness within, the quote comes in direct contradiction.*".

What I've learned from the past year, in trying to understand myself is that I've accepted that there are many contradictions in life. If we wanted to improve ourselves, we also have to know our current limits. If we wanted to care for ourselves, we also have to care for others for self-care can only happen when you have a bunch of people or a social system that enables you to do so. We want excitement in life but we also want stability.  We want to be able to connect to people but we also want to be able to spend some time for ourselves. If we wanted to be present for someone, be a good friend to someone, we also have to place our boundaries and take care of our own well-being.

Happiness has been an age-old question. Philosophers, scientists, normal people consider this as the holy grail. It is better than finding the Higgs boson. (Or maybe finding the Higgs gave people happiness!) In a broad sense, statistical ensemble sense, *Happiness* could be a function of our material conditions, the quality of our social relationships, our ability to make good decisions and even have choices! Before I talked about how *Happiness* was also a function of Productivity, happiness happens in the *doing* (and realized I was wrong and maybe [we don't have to do stuff all the time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arj7oStGLkU)). Even the ability to ask about the *Happiness question*, and have the time, financial, mental and emotional resources to be able answer that question like [here](https://www.buzzsprout.com/1030039/6057664) is a factor that contributes to happiness.

Happiness could be many things to different people. But I've learned that I shouldn't let happiness be *simply a function* of a singular person, a failed goal or relationship or any singular thing beyond one's control. Specially putting that burden on a single person is something that I personally would not like to do. It can hurt the person you love. Surely, those will influence our level of happiness, diminish it in unpredictable ways and times. But there are many other sources of happiness, while maybe not the same kind of feeling you once had, could be enough to make life worth living and more than worth waking up for in the morning. You can probably even learn to "synthesize" it!

Maybe sometimes, you just have to get something to eat, sit somewhere and relax. Maybe like the laughing kids, the pigeons, and the solution to my lost swiss pass, "Happiness will come to you." You do not have to feel it all the time.
You do not have to chase it.

P.S. Full disclosure, I had a bit of an existential crisis last week after feeling so satisfied with life the previous week. I have seen a pattern, that whenever I get sort of done with a big project, the lack of "direction" and external pressure, feels like an uncomfortable decompression symptomized by a momentary illusion of lack of meaning and purpose in life! Maybe also [burnout](https://open.spotify.com/episode/57lSXDGL5qiGCu1BWwHXJU?si=evxtl0IQS1SI9ITwElwcTw). I promised myself that I will not write anything in public out of anger or deep sadness. Even if I felt that only the "void" of the world wide web could understand me or hear me out. I wanted to change my behaviour and start talking to people I trusted instead. But I also understand the situation of people who have no one else to talk to but the "void" and due to some personal circumstances we cannot fully imagine, are unable to cultivate trusting relationships with other people. As they say, when "Physicists philosophize, they're in a crisis". Look at all those poor PhD students.
