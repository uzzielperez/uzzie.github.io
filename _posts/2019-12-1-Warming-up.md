## Sink or Swim. Never forget to play.

Just a little over a month left. I've done all the paper work and now I'm going to slowly warm up to the new work I'm about to do as well as start the more rigorous work for the dissertation.

I feel overwhelmed though. It's a different kind of discomfort to start some work you have very little experience with. It's also hard to just start working if there's a lot of work to be done. Sometimes, the path to the finish line is not very clear and that makes it harder for me to just get started. It's like when you have a puzzle or some physics problem, the solution is not always straightforward. The tendency is for me when I am uninterested, due to my mood or whatever reason, is to ignore it. Save myself from the cognitive load. But when I am interested, or when I make myself interested, I will explore all the facets of the puzzle. And then sometimes, I'd be lucky it becomes clear how I get to the finish line.

I find the comparison of finding a new place, maybe a friend's place to this process we're talking about. When we don't know the neighborhood, what we can do is walk around randomly, and eventually we naturally build a mental map of the area. With that mental map, we can systematically go from one point to another with very little difficulty. This is the reason why I think it's good to play around and try out new things. Just jump in the water and have fun! And it becomes easier to get over the fear of sinking for me.

I guess this is a good reminder for myself to start playing around again after a long while of deliberately preparing for an things. It's exploration and "diffuse" thinking mode ON again. Should be fun!
