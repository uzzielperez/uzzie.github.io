I think I was up past 3 am Monday morning refreshing James Spann and NWS Birmingham. Tornadoes develop rather quickly. Weather science is a clear example of how not everything is not deterministic or can be clearly predicted by equations or models. Weather prediction and earth systems physics is a whole different field that's quite interesting.

I've been looking at some [tornado paths](https://hifld-geoplatform.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/historical-tornado-tracks?geometry=-91.528%2C31.583%2C-83.684%2C34.800) around Tuscaloosa and the slope of the paths are quite the same. Interesting and something that you would expect, I guess from the motion of the earth.

Anyway, I think I'd like to make a simple app that pings me updates on Tornadoes in Tuscaloosa. But I'm in a middle of finishing phase I of my dissertation. I want to keep the momentum on that. It would be the same whether a make a pinging app or not. I will stay awake until things clear.

Tonight is just a brief respite. A respite. lol. I solved some problem in my analyzer code. I've been working on it quite intensely the past week. I've got a messy brute force solution but it seems to work. It's also *cute*. Tomorrow, I will start to write a cleaner version and close Phase I in a few days.

Wrote a bit tonight to clear my mind and also severe storms are expected in Tuscaloosa once again this Sunday. Hope everyone stays safe!
