## Getting Clues from experiments

There are some equations that we can derive using mathematics and our understanding of well-established physics principles. For instance, we can derive $$E=mc^2$$ from what we already know. But in particle physics, when we're trying to look for some physics beyond the Standard Model, we actually don't quite know what we're looking for. Some people make some assumptions or hypotheses to explain things we don't understand. For example, maybe the reason why gravity is so weak is because there are extradimensions! The extra strength must be leaking! With those new assumptions, you can derive the possible effects or manifestations of such a scenario in our world.

A specific example is the assumption that there are large extra dimensions.
If you'd collect all the proton-proton collisions that produced two photons, you pretty much know from the standard model how much you'll probably get as a function of the "invariant mass" of the two photons. But if we get something else, like an excess over what we expected, then something's going on. I got a plot that illustrates this from [an old diphoton paper from CMS](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1112.0688.pdf).

When we don't really know what's going on in detail and we have to rely on experimental observations. We don't exactly know the details of a theory but we can still make calculations or general predictions about how a new physics can manifest itself. And these manifestations are measurable quantities with soem finite error. For the case of a large extra dimension or some anomalous gauge coupling, we can see a non-resonant excess over the Standard Model background. (Sorry I'm speaking particle physics lingo! But you can try to picture it in the plot above.) This entire thing I'm talking about is what people call "Effective Field Theory" (EFT). I found a nice reading material for it from [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.05863.pdf).

I didn't know until my adviser told me that the "Fermi theory of weak interactions" was actually an EFT for weak interactions. But only for energies below the W and Z masses. I still don't fully know the details, or understand it but I plan to dig in more into this EFT thing in the future, for my dissertation.
