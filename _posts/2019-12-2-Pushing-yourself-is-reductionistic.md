At this point, I've been pushing myself back to working on physics even if I feel a little lazy. I feel the inertia of not being able to work for three weeks. I've been pushing myself to track my work time again, get past the fitness plateau that I've been in, learn French in a month, and finish the books I borrowed. And also maybe finally do that stand-up comedy thing!

But why only now? Why didn't I push myself the previous weeks? I felt I needed a break. I did a lot of thinking unrelated to my work. I just thought about people that mattered/matter to me. I ran thought experiments in my head of what life's like without them. I thought about how I impacted the people I cared about. Some positively. Some negatively. For a while, I was sadder than I would like to admit and was unexcited about what lies ahead.

I talked to a new therapist about this "skill" of pushing myself, and smiling, and trying to be happy, making jokes. He was the first professional I talked to who openly critiqued this idea of "pushing and pushing" oneself. But he was the second person who told me that cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) doesn't work for everyone. At that moment it felt like a light bulb just lit up in my head! He left a positive impression on me. I was humbled and enlightened at the same time. The first person who told me that CBT doesn't work for everyone was a good friend of mine who I thought understood a once very important person in my life the most. She told me that I should stop insisting on CBT for her. All this time, I had in the back of my mind that she was just not trying hard enough - to be happy.

The truth is, our life circumstances, the cards we were dealt with, present real barriers to the quality of life we aim to achieve. And for some people, these barriers can be in the form of either mental/physical illness that cannot be cured, only managed or treated. And yeah, I have those barriers too. I learned CBT 6 years ago and I thought it worked really well for me. Professionally, I was able to get past hurdles. But emotionally, I think I have a lot of growing up to do. She had those barriers too. So I thought, if she did what I did, we'd be ok. If she did it enough times, she'd be happy. But things are a lot more complicated than I thought. Sometimes, there are deep-seated issues we need to resolve or understand. I realized, CBT was probably just allowing me to sweep things under the rug. So there was some false sense of progress on the emotional side of me.

I tried to looked at myself from a third person point of view. When I am sad, I can run. Get those "happy hormones". I can play upbeat music in the morning. I can watch Ali Wong and other comedians I like! I can hang out with friends. I can distract myself from some kind of emotional pain I am feeling. But after that's done, I will feel sad once more. And now I think it's ok to feel that way. Sometimes, it's profound sadness. Sometimes, it's the kind of sadness you don't want to feel at all.

I realized, I never really allowed myself to cry and admit that I'm sad. So I never really fully healed because I didn't allow myself to grieve. There must be a good balance between allowing myself to cry, to think about the mistakes I have done, to think about the loss of an important person, and being able to be "ok" and happy from time to time. And I think that's where this superpower of being able to distract yourself comes in handy. Because I pushed myself to get up from bed in the morning, or lately, just walk, I get a new chance to just move forward in life. And now I'm becoming a little more excited for what's coming. I guess, things get better as I "age".

I've done a lot of thinking about my mistakes in life. I don't want to turn back time or make some things come back to how they used to be. There are people I would like to stay friends with but I have this fear of making the same mistakes. Could I be hardwired to hurt people? Or am I changeable for the better?

I need to learn how to handle excessive guilt. Make proper apologies. To see how my actions or inactions impacted someone rather than explaining away that I didn't intend to hurt them anyway. And if I were to try again in this aspect, I would do better. I guess being able to identify concrete things you can do, allows us to unlearn learned helplessness. To believe that we're redeemable rather than irredeemable makes us feel that life is still worth living.
