I got a cortisone shot on my butt today. It's meant to help me with the arthritis until we figure out a new treatment. :)
Don't worry it ain't a sad story. I was not able to sleep the past week so, I skipped work and tonight's party, surrendered and went to the ER. (This tells me I am no longer reliable for high energy physics which requires high energy people :P)

I waited around four hours to see the doctor. I assumed that they were going to send me home without a plan just because I wasn't dying yet.
That's how ERs work. But it was a lot of pain today. When my doctor finally came, he said to me to wait a few minutes as he needs to attend to another patient. He looked tired and irritable in the beginning.
He had red eyes, a sign I felt that he had not slept well. And I could see some mild dermatitis - a sign of stress. When he finally came, he asked me a question. My voice was too soft and he repeated his question with some irritation (or "perceived irritation").
I knew I didn't have the energy to tell my whole story. So I showed him what I wrote in my journal that summarized why I wanted to get checked. He looked at me differently and his eyes softened and spoke to me "I can see what you've been going through...".
It changed the dynamics of our conversation. A kind of conversation endemic to overworked doctors who don't have the mental and emotional bandwidth to fully understand what's going on. (I'm actually sick and tired of it... I'm glad tonight I felt understood and went home with a plan that suited my socioeconomic situation. But most importantly, we were two humans meeting eye-to-eye. I wasn't just another patient he just had to get rid off. Despite him being seemingly tired, his full kindness showed.)

The book "Deep Medicine- How Artificial Intelligence Can Make Healthcare Human Again" describes some endemic problems in the current healthcare system. It's amazing sometimes how you observe stuff in the world and then see someone else describe eloquently what you've been seeing. Like someone "sees you" or perfectly understands your pains and so many other people's pains.

I've thought about a solution to just one of these problems. And I've been talking to a lot of people about the viability and feasibility of creating this solution. Right now, this proposed solution is digital but I think that we shouldn't forget, that health problems are complex. Sometimes we overtechnologize solutions and forget that one of the most healing things in the world is to be simply listened to, to be understood, to be considered - to be connected to another human.

Anyway, tomorrow I go to social work because the most advanced treatment costs is about $2000. In the US they gave me financial support but here I need to find out.

As for the solution to medical cost pains for everyone, we're figuring something about that too but maybe the solution will crystalize later. *wink*
Also, I don't need pity. I need people to help me figure out how we could change the system. And I'm super thankful to all the people who makes me believe that we are on to something. I find that as comforting as leaning on to friends.
