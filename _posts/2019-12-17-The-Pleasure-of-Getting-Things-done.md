I told one of our postdocs today that I "got bored" and still worked today. Been soldiering through and I am glad I did. I intermittently take naps to combat the nausea from the legal opioids I got for the surgery. And I got a shot of "happiness" after solving one of the connectivity issues I had for the software we are developing. It's not really a big deal but it is for me because I sort of accomplished something and the "reward" part of the brain sort of lit up. *smilee* Haven't had that in a while.

I got the title from Feynman's "The Pleasure of Finding Things out". While I sort of am cautious about the "artificiality" of just checking off minor things off one's to-do list, sometimes, getting "minor" things done for yourself, deserve to be celebrated. I got my visa, took care of all the logistics quite ahead of time. I've done packing way early, e.g. spent the past 3 weeks pre-accident emptying my cabinets, giving away things. I felt good doing them early even if the idea of moving is a tedious and thankless thing to do. Now, I only need to make sure to move the furniture out to people who want them. And of course, the final vacuuming. My luggages, are sort of ready too. I don't know if it's me just being paranoid and knowing I'm not the best person with stress that I do things really early in bits and pieces. So, even if I'm one-legged (or three-legged), I don't feel too rushed right now. With help from friends of course! 

I think, I think of work in terms of making several iterations. I approach learning the same way. I learn about something, get a rough idea about what it is and then I refine my understanding by filling in the details with further iterations. Kinda nice way of looking at it. So maybe, that's probably helped me with putting things off, and "failing". It's a lot of work though. And I do envy those who are pretty good with pressure and can stay very calm under stress. And actually those who are "great procrastinators". They do exist and its funny how some Ivy league students claim to deliberately be good at "procrastinating" to be good with pressure. Dunno how true it is but it's not super unbelievable.
